<p>What have you done, what tools have you used, and what success have you had with your approach?

"10752","<p>I know the so-called textbook definition of unit tests and integration tests.  What I am curious about is when it is time to write unit tests... I will write them to cover as many sets of classes as possible.</p>

<p>For example, if I have a <code>Word</code> class, I will write some unit tests for the <code>Word</code> class.  Then, I begin writing my <code>Sentence</code> class, and when it needs to interact with the <code>Word</code> class, I will often write my unit tests such that they test both <code>Sentence</code> and <code>Word</code>... at least in the places where they interact.</p>

<p><em>Have these tests essentially become integration tests because they now test the integration of these 2 classes, or is it just a unit test that spans 2 classes?</em></p>

<p>In general, because of this uncertain line, I will rarely actually write integration tests... or is my using the finished product to see if all the pieces work properly the actual integration tests, even though they are manual and rarely repeated beyond the scope of each individual feature?</p>

<p>We're about to ramp up a new project where nearly all of our database op's will be fairly simple data retrievals (there's another segment of the project which already writes the data). Most of our other projects up to this point make use of stored procedures for such things. However, I'd like to leverage LINQ-to-SQL if it makes more sense.</p>

"16322","<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>One of the things I've asked a lot about on this site is <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/netframework/aa904594.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">LINQ</a>. The questions I've asked have been wide and varied and often don't have much context behind them. So in an attempt to consolidate the knowledge I've acquired on Linq I'm posting this question with a view to maintaining and updating it with additional information as I continue to learn about LINQ.</p>
<p>I also hope that it will prove to be a useful resource for other people wanting to learn about LINQ.</p>
<h2>What is LINQ?</h2>
<p>From <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/netframework/aa904594.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">MSDN</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The LINQ Project is a codename for a
set of extensions to the .NET
Framework that encompass
language-integrated query, set, and
transform operations. It extends C#
and Visual Basic with native language
syntax for queries and provides class
libraries to take advantage of these
capabilities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What this means is that LINQ provides a standard way to query a variety of datasources using a common syntax.</p>
<h2>What flavours of LINQ are there?</h2>
<p>Currently there are a few different LINQ providers provided by Microsoft:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb397919.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">Linq to Objects</a> which allows you to execute queries on any IEnumerable object.</li>
<li><a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb425822.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">Linq to SQL</a> which allows you to execute queries against a database in an object oriented manner.</li>
<li><a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb387098.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">Linq to XML</a> which allows you to query, load, validate, serialize and manipulate XML documents.</li>
<li><a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb386964.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">Linq to Entities</a> as suggested by <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16322/all-about-linq#33588"">Andrei</a></li>
<li><a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb399399.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">Linq to Dataset</a></li>
</ul>
<p>There are quite a few others, many of which are listed <a href=""http://blogs.microsoft.co.il/blogs/vardi/archive/2008/10/09/the-linq-list-projects.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a>.</p>
<h2>What are the benefits?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Standardized way to query multiple datasources</li>
<li>Compile time safety of queries</li>
<li>Optimized way to perform set based operations on in memory objects</li>
<li>Ability to debug queries</li>
</ul>

<h2>What do I need to use LINQ?</h2>
<p>Linq is currently available in VB.Net 9.0 and C# 3.0 so you'll need Visual Studio 2008 or greater to get the full benefits. (You could always write your code in notepad and compile using MSBuild)</p>
<p>There is also a tool called <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7652/querying-like-linq-when-you-dont-have-linq#7710"">LinqBridge</a> which will allow you to run Linq like queries in C# 2.0.</p>

"23287","<p>What is the best approach to calculating the largest prime factor of a number?</p>

<p>I'm thinking the most efficient would be the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Find lowest prime number that divides cleanly</li>
<li>Check if result of division is prime</li>
<li>If not, find next lowest</li>
<li>Go to 2.</li>
</ol>

<p>I'm basing this assumption on it being easier to calculate the small prime factors. Is this about right? What other approaches should I look into?</p>

<p>Edit: I've now realised that my approach is futile if there are more than 2 prime factors in play, since step 2 fails when the result is a product of two other primes, therefore a recursive algorithm is needed.</p>

<p>Edit again: And now I've realised that this does still work, because the last found prime number has to be the highest one, therefore any further testing of the non-prime result from step 2 would result in a smaller prime.</p>

"24109","<p>I want to expand my programming horizons to Linux. A good, dependable basic toolset is important, and what is more basic than an IDE?</p>

<p>I could find these SO topics:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2756/lightweight-ide-for-linux"">Lightweight IDE for linux</a> and</li>
<li><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17228/what-tools-do-you-use-to-develop-c-applications-on-linux"">What tools do you use to develop
C++ applications on Linux?</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I'm not looking for a <em>lightweight</em> IDE. If an IDE is worth the money, then I will pay for it, so it need not be free.</p>

<p>My question, then:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>What good, C++ programming IDE is available for Linux?</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The minimums are fairly standard: syntax highlighting, code completion (like <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IntelliSense"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">intellisense</a> or its Eclipse counterpart) and integrated debugging (e.g., basic
breakpoints).</p>

<p>I have searched for it myself, but there are so many that it is almost impossible to separate the good from the bads by hand, especially for someone like me who has little  C++ coding experience in Linux. I know that <a href=""http://www.eclipse.org/cdt/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Eclipse supports C++</a>, and I really like that IDE for Java, but is it any good for C++ and is there something better?</p>

<p>The second post actually has some good suggestions, but what I am missing is what exactly makes the sugested IDE so good for the user, what are its (dis)advantages?</p>

<p>Maybe my question should therefore be:</p>

"24675","<p>Before you answer this I have never developed anything popular enough to attain high server loads. Treat me as (sigh) an alien that has just landed on the planet, albeit one that knows PHP and a few optimisation techniques.</p>

<hr>

<p>I'm developing a tool in <strong>PHP</strong> that could attain quite a lot of users, if it works out right. However while I'm fully capable of developing the program I'm pretty much clueless when it comes to making something that can deal with huge traffic. So here's a few questions on it (feel free to turn this question into a resource thread as well).</p>

<h2>Databases</h2>

<p>At the moment I plan to use the MySQLi features in PHP5. However how should I setup the databases in relation to users and content? Do I actually <em>need</em> multiple databases? At the moment everything's jumbled into one database - although I've been considering spreading user data to one, actual content to another and finally core site content (template masters etc.) to another. My reasoning behind this is that sending queries to different databases will ease up the load on them as one database = 3 load sources. Also would this still be effective if they were all on the same server?</p>

<h2>Caching</h2>

<p>I have a template system that is used to build the pages and swap out variables. Master templates are stored in the database and each time a template is called it's cached copy (a html document) is called. At the moment I have two types of variable in these templates - a static var and a dynamic var. Static vars are usually things like page names, the name of the site - things that don't change often; dynamic vars are things that change on each page load.</p>

<p>My question on this:</p>

<p>Say I have comments on different articles. Which is a better solution: store the simple comment template and render comments (from a DB call) each time the page is loaded or store a cached copy of the comments page as a html page - each time a comment is added/edited/deleted the page is recached.</p>

<h2>Finally</h2>

<p>Does anyone have any tips/pointers for running a high load site on PHP. I'm pretty sure it's a workable language to use - Facebook and Yahoo! give it great precedence - but are there any experiences I should watch out for?</p>

<p>Also, as a brief aside, is jQuery worth learning? Or should I look at different JavaScript libraries? I know Jeff uses jQuery on Stack Overflow and it seems to be working well.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: jQuery's website has a <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">pretty big list of tutorials</a>, and a seemingly comprehensive <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Main_Page"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">documentation page</a>. I haven't had time to go through it all yet, has anyone else had experience with it?</p>

<p><strong>Edit 2</strong>: It seems Google is now hosting the jQuery libraries. That should give jQuery a pretty big advantage in terms of publicity. </p>

<p>Also, if everyone uses a single unified aQuery library hosted at the same place, it should get cached for most Internet users early on and therefore not impact the download footprint of your site should you decide to use it.</p>

<h2>2 Months Later...</h2>

<p><strong>Edit 3</strong>: I started using jQuery on a project at work recently and it is great to work with! Just wanted to let everyone know that I have concluded it is <strong><em>ABSOLUTELY</em></strong> worth it to learn and use jQuery.</p>

<p>Also, I learned almost entirely from the Official jQuery <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Main_Page"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">documentation</a> and <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">tutorials</a>. It's very straightforward.</p>

<h2>10 Months Later...</h2>

<p>jQuery is a part of just about every web app I've made since I initially wrote this post. It makes progressive enhancement a breeze, and helps make the code maintainable.</p>

<p>Also, all the jQuery plug-ins are an invaluable resource!</p>

<h2>3 Years Later...</h2>

<p>Still using jQuery just about every day. I now author jQuery plug-ins and consult full time. I'm primarily a Djangonaut but I've done several javascript only contracts with jQuery. It's a life saver.</p>

<p>From one jQuery user to another... You should look at <a href=""http://api.jquery.com/category/plugins/templates/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">templating with jQuery</a> (or underscore -- see below).</p>

"32414","<p>We are currently working in a private beta and so are still in the process of making fairly rapid changes, although obviously as usage is starting to ramp up, we will be slowing down this process.  That being said, one issue we are running into is that after we push out an update with new JavaScript files, the client browsers still use the cached version of the file and they do not see the update.  Obviously, on a support call, we can simply inform them to do a <kbd>ctrl</kbd><kbd>F5</kbd> refresh to ensure that they get the up-to-date files from the server, but it would be preferable to handle this before that time.</p>

<p>Our current thought is to simply attach a version number onto the name of the JavaScript files and then when changes are made, increment the version on the script and update all references.  This definitely gets the job done, but updating the references on each release could get cumbersome.</p>

<p>As I'm sure we're not the first ones to deal with this, I figured I would throw it out to the community.  How are you ensuring clients update their cache when you update your code?  If you're using the method described above, are you using a process that simplifies the change?</p>

"41479","<p>After discussion with colleagues regarding the use of the 'var' keyword in C# 3 I wondered what people's opinions were on the appropriate uses of type inference via var?</p>

<p>For example I rather lazily used var in questionable circumstances, e.g.:-</p>

<pre><code>foreach(var item in someList) { // ... } // Type of 'item' not clear.
var something = someObject.SomeProperty; // Type of 'something' not clear.
var something = someMethod(); // Type of 'something' not clear.
</code></pre>

<p>More legitimate uses of var are as follows:-</p>

<pre><code>var l = new List&lt;string&gt;(); // Obvious what l will be.
var s = new SomeClass(); // Obvious what s will be.
</code></pre>

<p>Interestingly LINQ seems to be a bit of a grey area, e.g.:-</p>

<pre><code>var results = from r in dataContext.SomeTable
              select r; // Not *entirely clear* what results will be here.
</code></pre>

<p>It's clear what results will be in that it will be a type which implements IEnumerable, however it isn't entirely obvious in the same way a var declaring a new object is.</p>

<p>It's even worse when it comes to LINQ to objects, e.g.:-</p>

<pre><code>var results = from item in someList
              where item != 3
              select item;
</code></pre>

<p>This is no better than the equivilent foreach(var item in someList) { // ... } equivilent.</p>

<p>There is a real concern about type safety here - for example if we were to place the results of that query into an overloaded method that accepted IEnumerable&lt;int&gt; and IEnumerable&lt;double&gt; the caller might inadvertently pass in the wrong type.</p>

<p><code>var</code> <em>does</em> maintain strong typing but the question is really whether it's dangerous for the type to not be immediately apparent on definition, something which is magnified when overloads mean compiler errors might not be issued when you unintentionally pass the wrong type to a method.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Finally a short story for the record.
  In 1968, the Communications of the ACM
  published a text of mine under the
  title ""<em>The goto statement considered
  harmful</em>"", which in later years would
  be most frequently referenced,
  regrettably, however, often by authors
  who had seen no more of it than its
  title, which became a cornerstone of
  my fame by becoming a template: we
  would see all sorts of articles under
  the title ""X considered harmful"" for
  almost any X, including one titled
  ""Dijkstra considered harmful"". But
  what had happened? I had submitted a
  paper under the title ""<strong><em>A case against
  the goto statement</em></strong>"", which, in order
  to speed up its publication, the
  editor had changed into a ""letter to
  the Editor"", and in the process he had
  given it a new title of his own
  invention! The editor was Niklaus
  Wirth.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A well thought out classic paper about this topic, to be matched to that of Dijkstra, is <a href=""http://www.clifford.at/cfun/cliffdev/p261-knuth.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">Structured Programming with go to Statements</a>, by Donald E. Knuth. Reading both helps to reestablish context and a non-dogmatic understanding of the subject. In this paper, Dijkstra's opinion on this case is reported and is even more strong:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Donald E. Knuth:</em> I believe that by presenting such a
  view I am not in fact disagreeing
  sharply with Dijkstra's ideas, since
  he recently wrote the following:
  ""Please don't fall into the trap of
  believing that I am terribly
  dogmatical about [the go to
  statement]. <strong>I have the uncomfortable
  feeling that others are making a
  religion out of it, as if the
  conceptual problems of programming
  could be solved by a single trick, by
  a simple form of coding discipline!</strong>""</p>

<p>To clarify, I would like to get the current CPU usage for the whole system, not just the Java process(es).</p>

<p>The SIGAR API provides all the functionality I'm looking for in one package, so it's the best answer to my question so far. However, due it being licensed under the GPL, I cannot use it for my original purpose (a closed source, commercial product). It's possible that Hyperic may license SIGAR for commercial use, but I haven't looked into it. For my GPL projects, I will definitely consider SIGAR in the future.</p>

<p>For my current needs, I'm leaning towards the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>For CPU usage, <code>OperatingSystemMXBean.getSystemLoadAverage() / OperatingSystemMXBean.getAvailableProcessors()</code> (load average per cpu)</li>
<li>For memory, <code>OperatingSystemMXBean.getTotalPhysicalMemorySize()</code> and <code>OperatingSystemMXBean.getFreePhysicalMemorySize()</code></li>
<li>For disk space, <code>File.getTotalSpace()</code> and <code>File.getUsableSpace()</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Limitations:</p>

<p>The <code>getSystemLoadAverage()</code> and disk space querying methods are only available under Java 6. Also, some JMX functionality may not be available to all platforms (i.e. it's been reported that <code>getSystemLoadAverage()</code> returns -1 on Windows).</p>

<p>EDIT: The following code was helpful with chaining. However, (in Internet&nbsp;Explorer) <code>.val('whatever')</code> did not select the option that was added. (I did use the same 'value' in both <code>.append</code> and <code>.val</code>.)</p>

<pre><code>$('#mySelect').find('option').remove().end()

<p>EDIT: Trying to get it to mimic this code, I use the following code whenever the page/form is reset. This select box is populated by a set of radio buttons. <code>.focus()</code> was closer, but the option did not appear selected like it does with <code>.selected= ""true""</code>.

"61401","<p>I know this sounds like a point-whoring question but let me explain where I'm coming from.</p>

<p>Out of college I got a job at a PHP shop.  I worked there for a year and a half and thought that I had learned all there was to learn about programming.</p>

<p>Then I got a job as a one-man internal development shop at a sizable corporation where all the work was in C#.  In my commitment to the position I started reading a ton of blogs and books and quickly realized how wrong I was to think I knew everything.  I learned about unit testing, dependency injection and decorator patterns, the design principle of loose coupling, the composition over inheritance debate, and so on and on and on - I am still very much absorbing it all.  Needless to say my programming style has changed entirely in the last year.</p>

<p>Now I find myself picking up a php project doing some coding for a friend's start-up and I feel completely constrained as opposed to programming in C#.  It really bothers me that all variables at a class scope have to be referred to by appending '$this->' .  It annoys me that none of the IDEs that I've tried have very good intellisense and that my SimpleTest unit tests methods have to start with the word 'test'.  It drives me crazy that dynamic typing keeps me from specifying implicitly which parameter type a method expects, and that you have to write a switch statement to do method overloads.  I can't stand that you can't have nested namespaces and have to use the :: operator to call the base class's constructor.</p>

<p>Now I have no intention of starting a PHP vs C# debate, rather what I mean to say is that I'm sure there are some PHP features that I either don't know about or know about yet fail to use properly.  I am set in my C# universe and having trouble seeing outside the glass bowl.</p>

<p>So I'm asking, what are your favorite features of PHP?  What are things you can do in it that you can't or are more difficult in the .Net languages?</p>

"63421","<p>Currently my workflow with Emacs when I am coding in C or C++ involves three windows.  The largest on the right contains the file I am working with.  The left is split into two, the bottom being a shell which I use to type in compile or make commands, and the top is often some sort of documentation or README file that I want to consult while I am working.  Now I know there are some pretty expert Emacs users out there, and I am curious what other Emacs functionally is useful if the intention is to use it as a complete IDE.  Specifically, most IDEs usually fulfill these functions is some form or another:</p>

<ul>
<li>Source code editor</li>
<li>Compiler</li>
<li>Debugging</li>
<li>Documentation Lookup</li>
<li>Version Control</li>
<li>OO features like class lookup and object inspector </li>
</ul>

<p>For a few of these, it's pretty obvious how Emacs can fit these functions, but what about the rest?  Also, if a specific language must be focused on, I'd say it should be C++. </p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> One user pointed out that I should have been more specific when I said 'what about the rest'.  Mostly I was curious about efficient version control, as well as documentation lookup.  For example, in SLIME it is fairly easy to do a quick hyperspec lookup on a Lisp function.

"70528","<p>Python gives us the ability to create 'private' methods and variables within a class by prepending double underscores to the name, like this: <code>__myPrivateMethod()</code>. How, then, can one explain this</p>

<pre><code>>>> class MyClass:
...     def myPublicMethod(self):
...             print 'public method'
...     def __myPrivateMethod(self):
...             print 'this is private!!'
... 
>>> obj = MyClass()
>>> obj.myPublicMethod()

AttributeError: MyClass instance has no attribute '__myPrivateMethod'
>>> dir(obj)
['_MyClass__myPrivateMethod', '__doc__', '__module__', 'myPublicMethod']
>>> obj._MyClass__myPrivateMethod()
this is private!!
</code></pre>

<p>What's the deal?!</p>

<p>I'll explain this a little for those who didn't quite get that.</p>

<pre><code>>>> class MyClass:
...     def myPublicMethod(self):
...             print 'public method'
...     def __myPrivateMethod(self):
...             print 'this is private!!'
... 
>>> obj = MyClass()
</code></pre>

<p>What I did there is create a class with a public method and a private method and instantiate it.</p>

<p>Next, I call its public method.</p>

<pre><code>>>> obj.myPublicMethod()
public method
</code></pre>

<p>Next, I try and call its private method.</p>

<pre><code>>>> obj.__myPrivateMethod()
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File """", line 1, in 
AttributeError: MyClass instance has no attribute '__myPrivateMethod'
</code></pre>

<p>Everything looks good here; we're unable to call it. It is, in fact, 'private'. Well, actually it isn't. Running <em>dir()</em> on the object reveals a new magical method that python creates magically for all of your 'private' methods.</p>

<pre><code>>>> dir(obj)
['_MyClass__myPrivateMethod', '__doc__', '__module__', 'myPublicMethod']
</code></pre>

<p>This new method's name is always an underscore, followed by the class name, followed by the method name.</p>

<pre><code>>>> obj._MyClass__myPrivateMethod()
this is private!!
</code></pre>

<p>Say I'm creating a word frequency list, using a Map (probably a HashMap), where each key is a String with the word that's being counted and the value is an Integer that's incremented each time a token of the word is found.</p>

<p>In Perl, incrementing such a value would be trivially easy:</p>

<pre><code>$map{$word}++;
</code></pre>

<p>But in Java, it's much more complicated. Here the way I'm currently doing it:</p>

<pre><code>int count = map.containsKey(word) ? map.get(word) : 0;
map.put(word, count + 1);
</code></pre>

<p>Which of course relies on the autoboxing feature in the newer Java versions. I wonder if you can suggest a more efficient way of incrementing such a value. Are there even good performance reasons for eschewing the Collections framework and using a something else instead?</p>

<p>I've always been searching for a way to make Visual Studio draw a line after a certain amount of characters.</p>

<p>Below is a guide to enable these so called <em>guidelines</em> for various versions of Visual Studio.</p>

<p><strong>Visual Studio 2013</strong></p>

<p>Install Paul Harrington's Editor Guidelines extension for <a href=""http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/da227a0b-0e31-4a11-8f6b-3a149cf2e459/view/Reviews"" rel=""noreferrer"">VS 2013</a></p>

<p><strong>Visual Studio 2010 and 2012</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Install Paul Harrington's Editor Guidelines extension for <a href=""http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/0fbf2878-e678-4577-9fdb-9030389b338c"" rel=""noreferrer"">VS 2010</a> or <a href=""http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/da227a0b-0e31-4a11-8f6b-3a149cf2e459?SRC=Home"" rel=""noreferrer"">VS 2012</a>.</li>
<li>Open the registry at:
<br />VS 2010: <code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\VisualStudio\10.0\Text Editor</code>
<br />VS 2012: <code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\VisualStudio\11.0\Text Editor</code>
<br />and add a new string called <code>Guides</code> with the value <code>RGB(100,100,100), 80</code>. The 
first part specifies the color, while the other one (<code>80</code>) is the column the line will be displayed.</li>
<li>Or install the <a href=""http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/7f2a6727-2993-4c1d-8f58-ae24df14ea91"" rel=""noreferrer"">Guidelines UI</a> extension (which is also a part of the <a href=""http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/d0d33361-18e2-46c0-8ff2-4adea1e34fef/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Productivity Power Tools</a>), which will add entries to the editor's context menu for adding/removing the entries without needing to edit the registry directly. The current disadvantage of this method is that you can't specify the column directly.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Visual Studio 2008 and Other Versions</strong></p>

<p>If you are using Visual Studio 2008 open the registry at <code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\VisualStudio\9.0\Text Editor</code> and add a new string called <code>Guides</code> with the value <code>RGB(100,100,100), 80</code>. The first part specifies the color, while the other one (<code>80</code>) is the column the line will be displayed. The vertical line will appear, when you restart Visual Studio.</p>

<p>This trick also works for various other version of Visual Studio, as long as you use the correct path:</p>

<pre><code>2003: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\VisualStudio\7.1\Text Editor
2005: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\VisualStudio\8.0\Text Editor
2008: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\VisualStudio\9.0\Text Editor
2008 Express: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\VCExpress\9.0\Text Editor
</code></pre>

   From another question I provided an answer that has links to a lot of questions/answers about singletons: <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1008019/c-singleton-design-pattern/1008289#1008289"">More info about singletons here:</a></p>

<p>So I have read the thread <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11831/singletons-good-design-or-a-crutch"">Singletons: good design or a crutch?</a><br>
And the argument still rages.</p>

<p>I see Singletons as a Design Pattern (good and bad).<br><br>
The problem with Singleton is not the Pattern but rather the users (sorry everybody). Everybody and their father thinks they can implement one correctly (and from the many interviews I have done, most people can't). Also because everybody thinks they can implement a correct Singleton they abuse the Pattern and use it in situations that are not appropriate (replacing global variables with Singletons!).</p>

<p>So the main questions that need to be answered are:</p>

<ul>
<li>When should you use a Singleton</li>
<li>How do you implement a Singleton correctly</li>
</ul>

<p>My hope for this article is that we can collect together in a single place (rather than having to google and search multiple sites) an authoritative source of when (and then how) to use a Singleton correctly. Also appropriate would be a list of Anti-Usages and common bad implementations explaining why they fail to work and for good implementations their weaknesses.<br><br><hr></p>

<p>So get the ball rolling:<br>
I will hold my hand up and say this is what I use but probably has problems.<br>
I like ""Scott Myers"" handling of the subject in his books ""Effective C++""</p>

"90178","<p>I am working on a web application where I want the content to fill the height of the entire screen.</p>

<p>The page has a header, which contains a logo, and account information. This could be an arbitrary height. I want the content div to fill the rest of the page to the bottom.</p>

<p>I have a header <code>div</code> and a content <code>div</code>. At the moment I am using a table for the layout like so:</p>

<p>CSS and HTML</p>

<p><div class=""snippet"" data-lang=""js"" data-hide=""false"" data-console=""false"" data-babel=""false"">
<div class=""snippet-code"">
<pre class=""snippet-code-css lang-css prettyprint-override""><code>#page {
    height: 100%; width: 100%
}

#tdcontent {
    height: 100%;
}

#content {
    overflow: auto; /* or overflow: hidden; */
}</code></pre>
<pre class=""snippet-code-html lang-html prettyprint-override""><code>&lt;table id=""page""&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td id=""tdheader""&gt;
            &lt;div id=""header""&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td id=""tdcontent""&gt;
            &lt;div id=""content""&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</p>

<p>The entire height of the page is filled, and no scrolling is required.</p>

<p>For anything inside the content div, setting <code>top: 0;</code> will put it right underneath the header. Sometimes the content will be a real table, with its height set to 100%. Putting <code>header</code> inside <code>content</code> will not allow this to work.</p>

<p>Is there a way to achieve the same effect without using the <code>table</code>?</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>Elements inside the content <code>div</code> will have heights set to percentages as well. So something at 100% inside the <code>div</code> will fill it to the bottom. As will two elements at 50%.</p>

<p><strong>Update 2:</strong></p>

<p>For instance, if the header takes up 20% of the screen's height, a table specified at 50% inside <code>#content</code> would take up 40% of the screen space. So far, wrapping the entire thing in a table is the only thing that works.</p>

static int foo = 1;            static int foo = 10;

"94227","<p>C++ is all about memory ownership - aka <strong>ownership semantics</strong>.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the owner of a chunk of dynamically allocated memory to release that memory. So the question really becomes who owns the memory.</p>
<p>In C++ ownership is documented by the type a <em>raw</em> pointer is wrapped inside thus in a good (IMO) C++ program it is very rare (<em>rare</em>, not <em>never</em>) to see raw pointers passed around (as raw pointers have no inferred ownership thus we can not tell who owns the memory and thus without careful reading of the documentation you can't tell who is responsible for ownership).</p>
<p>Conversely, it is rare to see raw pointers stored in a class each raw pointer is stored within its own smart pointer wrapper. (<strong>N.B.:</strong> If you don't own an object you should not be storing it because you can not know when it will go out of scope and be destroyed.)</p>
<p>So the question:</p>
<ul>
<li>What type of ownership semantic have people come across?</li>
<li>What standard classes are used to implement those semantics?</li>
<li>In what situations do you find them useful?</li>
</ul>
<p>Lets keep 1 type of semantic ownership per answer so they can be voted up and down individually.</p>
<h2>Summary:</h2>
<p>Conceptually, smart pointers are simple and a naive implementation is easy. I have seen many attempted implementations, but invariably they are broken in some way that is not obvious to casual use and examples. Thus I recommend always using well tested smart pointers from a library rather than rolling your own. <code>std::auto_ptr</code> or one of the Boost smart pointers seem to cover all my needs.</p>
<h3><code>std::auto_ptr&lt;T&gt;</code>:</h3>
<p>Single person owns the object. Transfer of ownership is allowed.</p>
<p>Usage: This allows you to define interfaces that show the explicit transfer of ownership.</p>
<h3><code>boost::scoped_ptr&lt;T&gt;</code></h3>
<p>Single person owns the object. Transfer of ownership is NOT allowed.</p>
<p>Usage: Used to show explicit ownership. Object will be destroyed by destructor or when explicitly reset.</p>
<h3><code>boost::shared_ptr&lt;T&gt;</code> (<code>std::tr1::shared_ptr&lt;T&gt;</code>)</h3>
<p>Multiple ownership. This is a simple reference counted pointer. When the reference count reaches zero, the object is destroyed.</p>
<p>Usage: When an object can have multiple owers with a lifetime that can not be determined at compile time.</p>
<h3><code>boost::weak_ptr&lt;T&gt;</code>:</h3>
<p>Used with <code>shared_ptr&lt;T&gt;</code> in situations where a cycle of pointers may happen.</p>
<p>Usage: Used to stop cycles from retaining objects when only the cycle is maintaining a shared refcount.</p>

"142003","<p>I have a scenario. (Windows Forms, C#, .NET)</p>

<ol>
<li>There is a main form which hosts some user control.</li>
<li>The user control does some heavy data operation, such that if I directly call the <code>UserControl_Load</code> method the UI become nonresponsive for the duration for load method execution.</li>
<li>To overcome this I load data on different thread (trying to change existing code as little as I can)  </li>
<li>I used a background worker thread which will be loading the data and when done will notify the application that it has done its work.  </li>
<li>Now came a real problem. All the UI (main form and its child usercontrols) was created on the primary main thread. In the LOAD method of the usercontrol I'm fetching data based on the values of some control (like textbox) on userControl. </li>
</ol>

<p>The pseudocode would look like this:</p>

<p><strong>CODE 1</strong></p>

<pre><code>UserContrl1_LoadDataMethod()
{
    if (textbox1.text == ""MyName"") // This gives exception
    {
        //Load data corresponding to ""MyName"".
        //Populate a globale variable List&lt;string&gt; which will be binded to grid at some later stage.
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The Exception it gave was</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Cross-thread operation not valid: Control accessed from a thread other than the thread it was created on.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To know more about this I did some googling and a suggestion came up like using the following code</p>

<p><strong>CODE 2</strong></p>

<pre><code>UserContrl1_LoadDataMethod()
{
    if (InvokeRequired) // Line #1
    {
        this.Invoke(new MethodInvoker(UserContrl1_LoadDataMethod));
        return;
    }

    if (textbox1.text == ""MyName"") // Now it wont give an exception
    {
    //Load data correspondin to ""MyName""
        //Populate a globale variable List&lt;string&gt; which will be binded to grid at some later stage
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>BUT BUT BUT... it seems I'm back to square one. The Application again 
become nonresponsive. It seems to be due to the execution of line #1 if condition. The loading task is again done by the parent thread and not the third that I spawned.</p>

<p>I don't know whether I perceived this right or wrong. I'm new to threading.</p>

<p>How do I resolve this and also what is the effect of execution of Line#1 if block?</p>

"145110","<p>My understanding is that C/C++ produces native code to run on a particular machine architecture.  Conversely, languages like Java and C# run on top of a virtual machine which abstracts away the native architecture.  Logically it would seem impossible for Java or C# to match the speed of C++ because of this intermediate step, however I've been told that the latest compilers (""hot spot"") can attain this speed or even exceed it.</p>

<p>Perhaps this is more of a compiler question than a language question, but can anyone explain in plain English how it is possible for one of these virtual machine languages to perform better than a native language?</p>

"145131","<p>I work with a lot of web applications that are driven by databases of varying complexity on the backend. Typically, there's an <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping"" rel=""noreferrer"">ORM</a> layer separate from the business and presentation logic. This makes unit-testing the business logic fairly straightforward; things can be implemented in discrete modules and any data needed for the test can be faked through object mocking.</p>

<p>But testing the ORM and database itself has always been fraught with problems and compromises. </p>

<p>Over the years, I have tried a few strategies, none of which completely satisfied me.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Load a test database with known data. Run tests against the ORM and confirm that the right data comes back. The disadvantage here is that your test DB has to keep up with any schema changes in the application database, and might get out of sync. It also relies on artificial data, and may not expose bugs that occur due to stupid user input. Finally, if the test database is small, it won't reveal inefficiencies like a missing index. (OK, that last one isn't really what unit testing should be used for, but it doesn't hurt.)</p></li>
<li><p>Load a copy of the production database and test against that. The problem here is that you may have no idea what's in the production DB at any given time; your tests may need to be rewritten if data changes over time. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Some people have pointed out that both of these strategies rely on specific data, and a unit test should test only functionality. To that end, I've seen suggested:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use a mock database server, and check only that the ORM is sending the correct queries in response to a given method call.</li>
</ul>

I was hoping this was Kosher, but am I instead attempting to draw over other memory that I shouldn't be touching?</p>

<p>I was taking care to stack allocate things where I could, instead of heap allocating them. He was talking to me and watching over my shoulder and commented that it wasn't necessary because they are the same performance wise.</p>

<p>I was always under the impression that growing the stack was constant time, and heap allocation's performance depended on the current complexity of the heap for both allocation (finding a hole of the proper size) and de-allocating (collapsing holes to reduce fragmentation, as many standard library implementations take time to do this during deletes if I am not mistaken).</p>

<p>It is possible to use <a href=""http://www.otierney.net/objective-c.html#categories"" rel=""noreferrer"">categories</a> [e.g. MyClass (Private)] defined in MyClass.m file to group private methods.</p>

<p>This approach has 2 issues:</p>

<ol>
<li>Xcode (and compiler?) does not check if you define all methods in private category in corresponding @implementation block</li>
<li>You have to put @interface declaring your private category in the begin of MyClass.m file, otherwise Xcode complains with a message like ""self may not respond to message ""privateFoo"".</li>
</ol>

<p>The first issue can be worked around with <a href=""http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ObjectiveC/Articles/chapter_4_section_5.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30001163-CH20-SW2"" rel=""noreferrer"">empty category</a> [e.g. MyClass ()].<br/>

"187761","<p>POSIX allows mutexes to be recursive. That means the same thread can lock the same mutex twice and won't deadlock. Of course it also needs to unlock it twice, otherwise no other thread can obtain the mutex. Not all systems supporting pthreads also support recursive mutexes, but if they want to be <a href=""http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/pthread_mutexattr_gettype.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">POSIX conform, they have to</a>.</p>

<p>Other APIs (more high level APIs) also usually offer mutexes, often called Locks. Some systems/languages (e.g. Cocoa Objective-C) offer both, recursive and non recursive mutexes. Some languages also only offer one or the other one. E.g. in Java mutexes are always recursive (the same thread may twice ""synchronize"" on the same object). Depending on what other thread functionality they offer, not having recursive mutexes might be no problem, as they can easily be written yourself (I already implemented recursive mutexes myself on the basis of more simple mutex/condition operations).</p>

<p>What I don't really understand: What are non-recursive mutexes good for? Why would I want to have a thread deadlock if it locks the same mutex twice? Even high level languages that could avoid that (e.g. testing if this will deadlock and throwing an exception if it does) usually don't do that. They will let the thread deadlock instead.</p>

<p>Is this only for cases, where I accidentally lock it twice and only unlock it once and in case of a recursive mutex, it would be harder to find the problem, so instead I have it deadlock immediately to see where the incorrect lock appears? But couldn't I do the same with having a lock counter returned when unlocking and in a situation, where I'm sure I released the last lock and the counter is not zero, I can throw an exception or log the problem? Or is there any other, more useful use-case of non recursive mutexes that I fail to see? Or is it maybe just performance, as a non-recursive mutex can be slightly faster than a recursive one? However, I tested this and the difference is really not that big.</p>

<p>What minimalistic approach would you use to output that to HTML (or text, for that matter) as a correctly ordered, correctly indented tree? </p>

<p>Assume further you only have basic data structures (arrays and hashmaps), no fancy objects with parent/children references, no ORM, no framework, just your two hands. The table is represented as a result set, which can be accessed randomly. </p>

<p><strong>EDITS AND ADDITIONS</strong></p>

<p>To answer one commenter's (<a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/users/17826/mark-bessey"">Mark Bessey</a>'s) question: A root node is not necessary, because it is never going to be displayed anyway. ParentId = 0 is the convention to express ""these are top level"". The Order column defines how nodes with the same parent are going to be sorted.</p>

<p>The ""result set"" I spoke of can be pictured as an array of hashmaps (to stay in that terminology). For my example was meant to be already there. Some answers go the extra mile and construct it first, but thats okay.</p>

<p>The tree can be arbitrarily deep. Each node can have N children. I did not exactly have a ""millions of entries"" tree in mind, though.</p>

<p>Don't mistake my choice of node naming ('Node 1.1.1') for something to rely on. The nodes could equally well be called 'Frank' or 'Bob', no naming structure is implied, this was merely to make it readable.</p>

"218760","<p>Although elements like <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>s normally grow to fit their contents, using the <code>float</code> property can cause a startling problem for CSS newbies: <strong>If floated elements have non-floated parent elements, the parent will collapse.</strong></p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p><div class=""snippet"" data-lang=""js"" data-hide=""false"" data-console=""true"" data-babel=""false"">
<div class=""snippet-code"">
<pre class=""snippet-code-html lang-html prettyprint-override""><code>&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;div style=""float: left;""&gt;Div 1&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div style=""float: left;""&gt;Div 2&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</p>
<p>The parent div in this example will <strong>not expand</strong> to contain its floated children - it will appear to have <code>height: 0</code>.</p>
<h1>How do you solve this problem?</h1>
<p><em>I would like to create an exhaustive list of solutions here. If you're aware of cross-browser compatibility issues, please point them out.</em></p>
<h2>Solution 1</h2>
<p>Float the parent.</p>
<p><div class=""snippet"" data-lang=""js"" data-hide=""false"" data-console=""true"" data-babel=""false"">
<div class=""snippet-code"">
<pre class=""snippet-code-html lang-html prettyprint-override""><code>&lt;div style=""float: left;""&gt;
  &lt;div style=""float: left;""&gt;Div 1&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div style=""float: left;""&gt;Div 2&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong>: Semantic code.<br />
<strong>Cons</strong>: You may not always want the parent floated. Even if you do, do you float the parents' parent, and so on? Must you float every ancestor element?</p>
<h2>Solution 2</h2>
<p>Give the parent an explicit height.</p>
<p><div class=""snippet"" data-lang=""js"" data-hide=""false"" data-console=""true"" data-babel=""false"">
<div class=""snippet-code"">
<pre class=""snippet-code-html lang-html prettyprint-override""><code>&lt;div style=""height: 300px;""&gt;
  &lt;div style=""float: left;""&gt;Div 1&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div style=""float: left;""&gt;Div 2&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong>: Semantic code.<br />
<strong>Cons</strong>: Not flexible - if the content changes or the browser is resized, the layout will break.</p>
<h2>Solution 3</h2>
<p>Append a &quot;spacer&quot; element inside the parent element, like this:</p>
<p><div class=""snippet"" data-lang=""js"" data-hide=""false"" data-console=""true"" data-babel=""false"">
<div class=""snippet-code"">
<pre class=""snippet-code-html lang-html prettyprint-override""><code>&lt;div&gt;

  &lt;div style=""float: left;""&gt;Div 2&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class=""spacer"" style=""clear: both;""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong>: Straightforward to code.<br />
<strong>Cons</strong>: Not semantic; the spacer div exists only as a layout hack.</p>
<h2>Solution 4</h2>
<p>Set parent to <code>overflow: auto</code>.</p>
<p><div class=""snippet"" data-lang=""js"" data-hide=""false"" data-console=""true"" data-babel=""false"">
<div class=""snippet-code"">
<pre class=""snippet-code-html lang-html prettyprint-override""><code>&lt;div style=""overflow: auto;""&gt;
  &lt;div style=""float: left;""&gt;Div 1&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div style=""float: left;""&gt;Div 2&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong>: Doesn't require extra div.<br />
<strong>Cons</strong>: Seems like a hack - that's not the <code>overflow</code> property's stated purpose.</p>

<hr>

<p>This seems a bit bizarre to me, but as far as I can tell, this is how you do it.</p>

<p>I have a collection of objects, and I want users to select one or more of them.  This says to me ""form with checkboxes.""  My objects don't have any concept of ""selected"" (they're rudimentary POCO's formed by deserializing a wcf call).  So, I do the following:</p>

<pre><code>public class SampleObject{
  public Guid Id {get;set;}
  public string Name {get;set;}
}
</code></pre>

<p>In the view:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;%
    using (Html.BeginForm())
    {
%&gt;
  &lt;%foreach (var o in ViewData.Model) {%&gt;
    &lt;%=Html.CheckBox(o.Id)%&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;%= o.Name %&gt;
  &lt;%}%&gt;
  &lt;input type=""submit"" value=""Submit"" /&gt;
&lt;%}%&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And, in the controller, this is the only way I can see to figure out what objects the user checked:</p>

<pre><code>public ActionResult ThisLooksWeird(FormCollection result)
{
  var winnars = from x in result.AllKeys
          where result[x] != ""false""
          select x;
  // yadda
}
</code></pre>

<p>Its freaky in the first place, and secondly, for those items the user checked, the FormCollection lists its value as ""true false"" rather than just true.  </p>

<p>Obviously, I'm missing something.  I think this is built with the idea in mind that the objects in the collection that are acted upon within the html form are updated using <code>UpdateModel()</code> or through a ModelBinder.  </p>

<p>But my objects aren't set up for this; does that mean that this is the only way?  Is there another way to do it?</p>

Next, the actual question:
My team is restructuring our repository and I'm looking for hints on how to organize it. (SVN in this case).
Here's what we came up with. We have one repository, multiple projects and multiple svn:externals cross-references</p>

<pre><code>\commonTools /*tools used in all projects. Referenced in each project with svn:externals*/
   \NUnit.v2.4.8
   \NCover.v.1.5.8
   \&lt;other similar tools&gt;
\commonFiles /*settings strong name keys etc.*/
   \ReSharper.settings
   \VisualStudio.settings
\trash /*each member of the team has trash for samples, experiments etc*/
   \user1
   \user2
\projects
   \Solution1 /*Single actual project (Visual Studio Solution)*/
      \trunk
         \src
             \Project1 /*Each sub-project resulting in single .dll or .exe*/
             \Project2
         \lib
         \tools
         \tests
         \Solution1.sln
      \tags
      \branches
   \Solution2
      \trunk
         \src
             \Project3 /*Each sub-project resulting in single .dll or .exe*/
             \Project1 /*Project1 from Solution1 references with svn:externals*/
         \lib
         \tools
         \tests
         \Solution2.sln
      \tags
      \branches
</code></pre>

<p>To clear the vocabulary: Solution means single product, Project is a Visual Studio Project (that results in a single .dll or single .exe)</p>

<p>That's how we plan to lay out the repository. The main issue is, that we have multiple Solutions, but we want to share Projects among Solutions.
We thought that there is no point really in moving those shared Projects to their own Solutions, and instead we decided to use svn:externals to share Projects among Solutions. We also want to keep common set of tools and 3rd party libraries in one place in the repository, and them reference them in each Solution with svn:externals.</p>

<p>What do you think about this layout? Especially about the use of svn:externals. It's not an ideal solution, but considering all pros and cons, it's the best we could think of. How would YOU do it?</p>

  <p>Use a static class as a unit of
  organization for methods not
  associated with particular objects.
  Also, a static class can make your
  implementation simpler and faster
  because you do not have to create an
  object in order to call its methods.
  It is useful to organize the methods
  inside the class in a meaningful way,
  such as the methods of the Math class
  in the System namespace.</p>

Should my main() method be written to depend on the bean/application configuration to be in XML format - is that a safe assumption, or am I locking the user into something specific?</p>

"254281","<p>How do you properly override <code>isEqual:</code> in Objective-C?  The ""catch"" seems to be that if two objects are equal (as determined by the <code>isEqual:</code> method), they must have the same hash value.</p>

<p>The <a href=""http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CocoaFundamentals/CocoaObjects/CocoaObjects.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH4-SW25"" rel=""noreferrer"">Introspection</a> section of the <a href=""http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CocoaFundamentals/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Cocoa Fundamentals Guide</a> does have an example on how to override <code>isEqual:</code>, copied as follows, for a class named <code>MyWidget</code>:</p>

<pre><code>- (BOOL)isEqual:(id)other {
    if (other == self)
        return YES;
    if (!other || ![other isKindOfClass:[self class]])
        return NO;
    return [self isEqualToWidget:other];
}

- (BOOL)isEqualToWidget:(MyWidget *)aWidget {
    if (self == aWidget)
        return YES;
    if (![(id)[self name] isEqual:[aWidget name]])
        return NO;
    if (![[self data] isEqualToData:[aWidget data]])
        return NO;
    return YES;
}
</code></pre>

<p>It checks pointer equality, then class equality, and finally compares the objects using <code>isEqualToWidget:</code>, which only checks  the <code>name</code> and <code>data</code> properties.  What the example <em>doesn't</em> show is how to override <code>hash</code>.</p>

<p>Let's assume there are other properties that do not affect equality, say <code>age</code>.  Shouldn't the <code>hash</code> method be overridden such that only <code>name</code> and <code>data</code> affect the hash?  And if so, how would you do that? Just add the hashes of <code>name</code> and <code>data</code>?  For example:</p>

<pre><code>- (NSUInteger)hash {
    NSUInteger hash = 0;
    hash += [[self name] hash];
    hash += [[self data] hash];
    return hash;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Is that sufficient?  Is there a better technique?  What if you have primitives, like <code>int</code>?  Convert them to <code>NSNumber</code> to get their hash?  Or structs like <code>NSRect</code>?</p>

<li><p>Inheritance: extend the functionality of a class by creating a subclass. Override superclass members in the subclasses to provide new functionality.

"273695","<p>I've been using a local git repository interacting with my group's CVS repository for several months, now.  I've made an almost neurotic number of branches, most of which have thankfully merged back into my trunk.  But naming is starting to become an issue.  If I have a task easily named with a simple label, but I accomplish it in three stages which each include their own branch and merge situation, then I can repeat the branch name each time, but that makes the history a little confusing.  If I get more specific in the names, with a separate description for each stage, then the branch names start to get long and unwieldy.</p>

<p>I did learn looking through old threads here that I could start naming branches with a / in the name, i.e., topic/task, or something like that.  I may start doing that and seeing if it helps keep things better organized.</p>

<p>What are some best practices for naming git branches?</p>

<p>Edit:
Nobody has actually suggested any naming conventions.
I do delete branches when I'm done with them.  I just happen to have several around due to management constantly adjusting my priorities. :)
As an example of why I might need more than one branch on a task, suppose I need to commit the first discrete milestone in the task to the group's CVS repository.  At that point, due to my imperfect interaction with CVS, I would perform that commit and then kill that branch.  (I've seen too much weirdness interacting with CVS if I try to continue to use the same branch at that point.)</p>

<p>In our .sln, we have application A depending on assembly B which depends on assembly C.  In our case, there are dozens of ""B"" and a handful of ""C"".  Since these are all included in the .sln, we're using project references.  All assemblies currently build into $(SolutionDir)/Debug (or Release).</p>

<p>By default, Visual Studio marks these project references as ""Copy Local"", which results in    every ""C"" being copied into $(SolutionDir)/Debug once for every ""B"" that builds.  This seems wasteful.  What can go wrong if I just turn ""Copy Local"" off?  What do other people with large systems do?</p>

<p>FOLLOWUP:</p>

<p>Lots of responses suggest breaking up the build into smaller .sln files...  In the example above, I would build the foundation classes ""C"" first, followed by the bulk of the modules ""B"", and then a few applications, ""A"".  In this model, I need to have non-project references to C from B.  The problem I run into there is that ""Debug"" or ""Release"" gets baked into the hint path and I wind up building my Release builds of ""B"" against debug builds of ""C"".  </p>

Take your favorite language and tell me five things you hate about it. Those might be things that just annoy you, admitted design flaws, recognized performance problems, or any other category. You just have to hate it, and it has to be your favorite language.</p>

<p>Don't compare it to another language, and don't talk about languages that you already hate. Don't talk about the things you like in your favorite language. I just want to hear the things that you hate but tolerate so you can use all of the other stuff, and I want to hear it about the language you wished other people would use.</p>

<p>I ask this whenever someone tries to push their favorite language on me, and sometimes as an interview question. If someone can't find five things to hate about his favorite tool, he doesn't know it well enough to either advocate it or pull in the big dollars using it. He hasn't used it in enough different situations to fully explore it. He's advocating it as a culture or religion, which means that if I don't choose his favorite technology, I'm wrong.</p>

<p>I don't care that much which language you use. Don't want to use a particular language? Then don't. You go through due diligence to make an informed choice and still don't use it? Fine. Sometimes the right answer is ""You have a strong programming team with good practices and a lot of experience in Bar. Changing to Foo would be stupid.""</p>

<hr />

<p>This is a good question for code reviews too. People who really know a codebase will have all sorts of suggestions for it, and those who don't know it so well have non-specific complaints. I ask things like ""If you could start over on this project, what would you do differently?"" In this fantasy land, users and programmers get to complain about anything and everything they don't like. ""I want a better interface"", ""I want to separate the model from the view"", ""I'd use this module instead of this other one"", ""I'd rename this set of methods"", or whatever they really don't like about the current situation. That's how I get a handle on how much a particular developer knows about the codebase. It's also a clue about how much of the programmer's ego is tied up in what he's telling me.</p>

<p>Hate isn't the only dimension of figuring out how much people know, but I've found it to be a pretty good one. The things that they hate also give me a clue how well they are thinking about the subject.</p>

While I realize that the answers will be subjective, let's try to be as objective as we can and motivate the pros and cons we list.</p>

<p>Use the detail level you prefer for describing your architecture. For your answer to be of any value you'll at least have to describe the major technologies and ideas used in the architecture you describe. And last but not least, <em>when</em> should we use your architecture?</p>

<p>I'll start...</p>

<hr>

<h1>Overview of the architecture</h1>

<p>We use a 3-tier architecture based on open standards from Sun like Java EE, Java Persistence API, Servlet and Java Server Pages.</p>

<ul>
<li>Persistence</li>
<li>Business</li>
<li>Presentation</li>
</ul>

<p>The possible communication flows between the layers are represented by:</p>

<pre><code>Persistence &lt;-&gt; Business &lt;-&gt; Presentation
</code></pre>

<p>Which for example means that the presentation layer never calls or performs persistence operations, it always does it through the business layer. This architecture is meant to fulfill the demands of a high availability web application.</p>

<h2>Persistence</h2>

<p>Performs create, read, update and delete (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete"" rel=""noreferrer"">CRUD</a>) persistence operations. In our case we are using (<a href=""http://java.sun.com/javaee/technologies/persistence.jsp"" rel=""noreferrer"">Java Persistence API</a>) JPA and we currently use <a href=""http://www.hibernate.org/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Hibernate</a> as our persistence provider and use <a href=""http://www.hibernate.org/397.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">its EntityManager</a>.</p>

<p>This layer is divided into multiple classes, where each class deals with a certain type of entities (i.e. entities related to a shopping cart might get handled by a single persistence class) and is <em>used</em> by one and only one <em>manager</em>.</p>

<p>In addition this layer also stores <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Persistence_API#Entities"" rel=""noreferrer"">JPA entities</a> which are things like <code>Account</code>, <code>ShoppingCart</code> etc.</p>

<h2>Business</h2>

<p>All logic which is tied to the web application functionality is located in this layer. This functionality could be initiating a money transfer for a customer who wants to pay for a product on-line using her/his credit card. It could just as well be creating a new user, deleting a user or calculating the outcome of a battle in a web based game.</p>

<p>This layer is divided into multiple classes and each of these classes is annotated with <code>@Stateless</code> to become a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_Beans"" rel=""noreferrer"">Stateless Session Bean</a> (SLSB). Each SLSB is called a <em>manager</em> and for instance a manager could be a class annotated as mentioned called <code>AccountManager</code>.</p>

<p>When <code>AccountManager</code> needs to perform CRUD operations it makes the appropriate calls to an instance of <code>AccountManagerPersistence</code>, which is a class in the persistence layer. A rough sketch of two methods in <code>AccountManager</code> could be:</p>

<pre><code>...
public void makeExpiredAccountsInactive() {
    AccountManagerPersistence amp = new AccountManagerPersistence(...)
    // Calls persistence layer
    List&lt;Account&gt; expiredAccounts = amp.getAllExpiredAccounts();
    for(Account account : expiredAccounts) {
        this.makeAccountInactive(account)
    }
}
public void makeAccountInactive(Account account) {
    AccountManagerPersistence amp = new AccountManagerPersistence(...)
    account.deactivate();
    amp.storeUpdatedAccount(account); // Calls persistence layer
}
</code></pre>

<p>We use <a href=""http://java.sun.com/javaee/5/docs/tutorial/doc/bncij.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">container manager transactions</a> so we don't have to do transaction demarcation our self's. What basically happens under the hood is we initiate a transaction when entering the SLSB method and commit it (or rollback it) immediately before exiting the method. It's an example of convention over configuration, but we haven't had a need for anything but the default, Required, yet.</p>

<p>Here is how The Java EE 5 Tutorial from Sun explains the <a href=""http://java.sun.com/javaee/5/docs/tutorial/doc/bncij.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Required transaction attribute</a> for Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB's):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If the client is running within a
  transaction and invokes the enterprise
  bean’s method, the method executes
  within the client’s transaction. If
  the client is not associated with a
  transaction, the container starts a
  new transaction before running the
  method.</p>
  
  <p>The Required attribute is the implicit
  transaction attribute for all
  enterprise bean methods running with
  container-managed transaction
  demarcation. You typically do not set
  the Required attribute unless you need
  to override another transaction
  attribute. Because transaction
  attributes are declarative, you can
  easily change them later.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Presentation</h2>

<p>Our presentation layer is in charge of... presentation! It's responsible for the user interface and shows information to the user by building HTML pages and receiving user input through GET and POST requests. We are currently using the old <a href=""http://java.sun.com/products/servlet/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Servlet</a>'s + Java Server Pages (<a href=""http://java.sun.com/products/jsp/"" rel=""noreferrer"">JSP</a>) combination.</p>

<p>The layer calls methods in <em>managers</em> of the business layer to perform operations requested by the user and to receive information to show in the web page. Sometimes the information received from the business layer are less complex types as <code>String</code>'s and <code>int</code>egers, and at other times <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Persistence_API#Entities"" rel=""noreferrer"">JPA entities</a>.</p>

<h1>Pros and cons with the architecture</h1>

<h2>Pros</h2>

<ul>
<li>Having everything related to a specific way of doing persistence in this layer only means we can swap from using JPA into something else, without having to re-write anything in the business layer.</li>
<li>It's easy for us to swap our presentation layer into something else, and it's likely that we will if we find something better.</li>
<li>Letting the EJB container manage transaction boundaries is nice.</li>
<li>Using Servlet's + JPA is easy (to begin with) and the technologies are widely used and implemented in lots of servers.</li>
<li>Using Java EE is supposed to make it easier for us to create a high availability system with <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load_balancing_(computing)"" rel=""noreferrer"">load balancing</a> and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Failover"" rel=""noreferrer"">fail over</a>. Both of which we feel that we must have.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Cons</h2>

<ul>
<li>Using JPA you may store often used queries as named queries by using the <code>@NamedQuery</code> annotation on the JPA entity class. If you have as much as possible related to persistence in the persistence classes, as in our architecture, this will spread out the locations where you may find queries to include the JPA entities as well. It will be harder to overview persistence operations and thus harder to maintain.</li>
<li>We have JPA entities as part of our persistence layer. But <code>Account</code> and <code>ShoppingCart</code>, aren't they really business objects? It is done this way as you have to touch these classes and turn them into entities which JPA knows how to handle.</li>
<li>The JPA entities, which are also our business objects, are created like Data Transfer Objects (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Transfer_Object"" rel=""noreferrer"">DTO</a>'s), also known as Value Objects (VO's). This results in an <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemic_Domain_Model"" rel=""noreferrer"">anemic domain model</a> as the business objects have no logic of their own except accessor methods. All logic is done by our managers in the business layer, which results in a more procedural programming style. It's not good object oriented design, but maybe that's not a problem? (After all object orientation isn't the only programming paradigm which has delivered results.)</li>
<li>Using EJB and Java EE introduces a bit of complexity. And we can't use purely Tomcat (adding an EJB micro-container isn't <em>purely</em> Tomcat).</li>
<li>There are lots of issues with using Servlet's + JPA. Use Google for more information about these issues.</li>
<li>As the transactions are closed when exiting the business layer we can't load any information from JPA entities which is configured to be loaded from the database when it's needed (using <code>fetch=FetchType.LAZY</code>) from inside the presentation layer. It will trigger an exception. Before returning an entity containing these kinds of fields we have to be sure to call the relevant getter's. Another option is to use Java Persistence Query Language (<a href=""http://java.sun.com/javaee/5/docs/tutorial/doc/bnbtg.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">JPQL</a>) and do a <code>FETCH JOIN</code>. However both of these options are a little bit cumbersome.</li>

<li>tinyint, varchar fields containing the values 0/1,</li>

<p>And the <code>views.py</code> is also basic:</p>

    else:

    return render_to_response('addclient.html', {'form': form, 'the_company':the_company})

<hr>

<p>I've tried the different solutions to the problem:</p>

<ul>
<li>After exhaustive testing, I found that adding <code>0.5</code> to the result of Math.sqrt() is not necessary, at least not on my machine.</li>
<li>The <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_inverse_square_root"" rel=""noreferrer"">fast inverse square root</a> was faster, but it gave incorrect results for n >= 410881.  However, as suggested by <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/users/38426/bobbyshaftoe"">BobbyShaftoe</a>, we can use the FISR hack for n &lt; 410881.</li>
<li>Newton's method was a good bit slower than <code>Math.sqrt()</code>.  This is probably because <code>Math.sqrt()</code> uses something similar to Newton's Method, but implemented in the hardware so it's much faster than in Java.  Also, Newton's Method still required use of doubles.</li>
<li>A modified Newton's method, which used a few tricks so that only integer math was involved, required some hacks to avoid overflow (I want this function to work with all positive 64-bit signed integers), and it was still slower than <code>Math.sqrt()</code>.</li>
<li>Binary chop was even slower.  This makes sense because the binary chop will on average require 16 passes to find the square root of a 64-bit number.</li>
<li>According to John's tests, using <code>or</code> statements is faster in C++ than using a <code>switch</code>, but in Java and C# there appears to be no difference between <code>or</code> and <code>switch</code>.</li>
<li>I also tried making a lookup table (as a private static array of 64 boolean values).  Then instead of either switch or <code>or</code> statement, I would just say <code>if(lookup[(int)(n&amp;0x3F)]) { test } else return false;</code>.  To my surprise, this was (just slightly) slower. This is because <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/299079/why-is-this-code-with-several-or-statements-slightly-faster-than-using-a-lookup-t#299205"">array bounds are checked in Java</a>. </li>

"299068","<p>Question:  Is exception handling in Java actually slow?</p>

<p>Conventional wisdom, as well as a lot of Google results, says that exceptional logic shouldn't be used for normal program flow in Java.  Two reasons are usually given,</p>

<ol>
<li>it is really slow - even an order of magnitude slower than regular code (the reasons given vary),  </li>
</ol>

<p>and </p>

<ol start=""2"">
<li>it is messy because people expect only errors to be handled in exceptional code.  </li>
</ol>

<p>This question is about #1.</p>

<p>As an example, <a href=""http://leepoint.net/notes-java/flow/exceptions/03exceptions.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">this page</a> describes Java exception handling as ""very slow"" and relates the slowness to the creation of the exception message string - ""this string is then used in creating the exception object that is thrown. This is not fast.""  The article <a href=""http://adtmag.com/articles/2000/08/22/effective-exception-handling-in-java.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">Effective Exception Handling in Java</a> says that ""the reason for this is due to the object creation aspect of exception handling, which thereby makes throwing exceptions inherently slow"".  Another reason out there is that the stack trace generation is what slows it down.</p>

<p>My testing (using Java 1.6.0_07, Java HotSpot 10.0, on 32 bit Linux), indicates that exception handling is no slower than regular code.  I tried running a method in a loop that executes some code.  At the end of the method, I use a boolean to indicate whether to <em>return</em> or <em>throw</em>.  This way the actual processing is the same. I tried running the methods in different orders and averaging my test times, thinking it may have been the JVM warming up.  In all my tests, the throw was at least as fast as the return, if not faster (up to 3.1% faster).  I am completely open to the possibility that my tests were wrong, but I haven't seen anything out there in the way of the code sample, test comparisons, or results in the last year or two that show exception handling in Java to actually be slow.</p>

<p>What leads me down this path was an API I needed to use that threw exceptions as part of normal control logic.  I wanted to correct them in their usage, but now I may not be able to.  Will I instead have to praise them on their forward thinking?</p>

<p>In the paper <a href=""http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=337453"" rel=""noreferrer"">Efficient Java exception handling in just-in-time compilation</a>, the authors suggest that the presence of exception handlers alone, even if no exceptions are thrown, is enough to prevent the JIT compiler from optimizing the code properly, thus slowing it down.

"301134","<p>I'm writing a Python application that takes as a command as an argument, for example:</p>

<pre><code>$ python myapp.py command1
</code></pre>

<p>I want the application to be extensible, that is, to be able to add new modules that implement new commands without having to change the main application source. The tree looks something like:</p>

<pre><code>myapp/
    __init__.py
    commands/
        __init__.py
        command1.py
        command2.py
    foo.py
    bar.py
</code></pre>

<p>So I want the application to find the available command modules at runtime and execute the appropriate one.</p>

<p>Python defines an <strong>__import__</strong> function, which takes a string for a module name:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>__import__(name, globals=None, locals=None, fromlist=(), level=0)</p>
  
  <p>The function imports the module name, potentially using the given globals and locals to determine how to interpret the name in a package context. The fromlist gives the names of objects or submodules that should be imported from the module given by name. </p>
  
  <p>Source: <a href=""https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#__import__"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#<strong>import</strong></a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So currently I have something like:</p>

<pre><code>command = sys.argv[1]
try:
    command_module = __import__(""myapp.commands.%s"" % command, fromlist=[""myapp.commands""])
except ImportError:
    # Display error message

command_module.run()
</code></pre>

<p>This works just fine, I'm just wondering if there is possibly a more idiomatic way to accomplish what we are doing with this code.</p>

<p>Note that I specifically don't want to get in to using eggs or extension points. This is not an open-source project and I don't expect there to be ""plugins"". The point is to simplify the main application code and remove the need to modify it each time a new command module is added.</p>

<p>So what I need is a beginner's <strong>practical</strong> guide to Git.  ""Beginner"" being defined as someone who knows how to handle their compiler, understands to some level what a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_%28software%29"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Makefile</a> is, and has touched source control without understanding it very well.</p>

<p>""Practical"" being defined as this person doesn't want to get into great detail regarding what Git is doing in the background, and doesn't even care (or know) that it's distributed.  Your answers might hint at the possibilities, but try to aim for the beginner that wants to keep a 'main' repository on a 'server' which is backed up and secure, and treat their local repository as merely a 'client' resource.</p>

"316780","<p>I'm developing a multilanguage software. As far as the application code goes, localizability is not an issue. We can use language specific resources and have all kinds of tools that work well with them.</p>

<p>But what is the best approach in defining a multilanguage database schema? Let's say we have a lot of tables (100 or more), and each table can have multiple columns that can be localized (most of nvarchar columns should be localizable). For instance one of the tables might hold product information:</p>

<pre class=""lang-sql prettyprint-override""><code>CREATE TABLE T_PRODUCT (
  NAME        NVARCHAR(50),
  DESCRIPTION NTEXT,
  PRICE       NUMBER(18, 2)
)
</code></pre>

<p>I can think of three approaches to support multilingual text in NAME and DESCRIPTION columns:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Separate column for each language</p>

<p>When we add a new language to the system, we must create additional columns to store the translated text, like this:</p>

<pre class=""lang-sql prettyprint-override""><code>CREATE TABLE T_PRODUCT (
  NAME_EN        NVARCHAR(50),
  NAME_DE        NVARCHAR(50),
  NAME_SP        NVARCHAR(50),
  DESCRIPTION_EN NTEXT,
  DESCRIPTION_DE NTEXT,
  DESCRIPTION_SP NTEXT,
  PRICE          NUMBER(18,2)
)
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Translation table with columns for each language</p>

<p>Instead of storing translated text, only a foreign key to the translations table is stored. The translations table contains a column for each language.</p>

<pre class=""lang-sql prettyprint-override""><code>CREATE TABLE T_PRODUCT (
  NAME_FK        int,
  DESCRIPTION_FK int,
  PRICE          NUMBER(18, 2)
)

CREATE TABLE T_TRANSLATION (
  TRANSLATION_ID,
  TEXT_EN NTEXT,
  TEXT_DE NTEXT,
  TEXT_SP NTEXT
)
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Translation tables with rows for each language</p>

<p>Instead of storing translated text, only a foreign key to the translations table is stored. The translations table contains only a key, and a separate table contains a row for each translation to a language.</p>

<pre class=""lang-sql prettyprint-override""><code>CREATE TABLE T_PRODUCT (
  NAME_FK        int,
  DESCRIPTION_FK int,
  PRICE          NUMBER(18, 2)
)

CREATE TABLE T_TRANSLATION (
  TRANSLATION_ID
)

CREATE TABLE T_TRANSLATION_ENTRY (
  TRANSLATION_FK,
  LANGUAGE_FK,
  TRANSLATED_TEXT NTEXT
)

CREATE TABLE T_TRANSLATION_LANGUAGE (
  LANGUAGE_ID,
  LANGUAGE_CODE CHAR(2)
)
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<p>There are pros and cons to each solution, and I would like to know what are your experiences with these approaches, what do you recommend and how would you go about designing a multilanguage database schema.</p>

One article I found <a href=""http://www.defmacro.org/ramblings/fp.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">makes a fairly strong claim</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Most people I've met have read 
  <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns"" rel=""noreferrer"">the Design Patterns book</a> by the Gang of
  Four (GoF). Any self respecting programmer
  will tell you that the book is
  language agnostic and the patterns
  apply to software engineering in
  general, regardless of which language
  you use. This is a noble claim.
  Unfortunately it is far removed from
  the truth.</p>
  
  <p>Functional languages are extremely
  expressive. <strong>In a functional language
  one does not need design patterns
  because the language is likely so high
  level, you end up programming in
  concepts that eliminate design
  patterns all together.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The main features of functional programming (FP) include functions as first-class values, currying, immutable values, etc. It doesn't seem obvious to me that OO design patterns are approximating any of those features.</p>

<p>Additionally, in functional languages which support OOP (such as F# and OCaml), it seems obvious to me that programmers using these languages would use the same design patterns found available to every other OOP language. In fact, right now I use F# and OCaml every day, and there are no striking differences between the patterns I use in these languages vs. the patterns I use when I write in Java.</p>

<p>Is there any truth to the claim that functional programming eliminates the need for OOP design patterns? If so, could you post or link to an example of a typical OOP design pattern and its functional equivalent?</p>

"328356","<p>I'd like to extract the text from an HTML file using Python.  I want essentially the same output I would get if I copied the text from a browser and pasted it into notepad.  </p>

<p>I'd like something more robust than using regular expressions that may fail on poorly formed HTML.  I've seen many people recommend Beautiful Soup, but I've had a few problems using it.  For one, it picked up unwanted text, such as JavaScript source.  Also, it did not interpret HTML entities.  For example, I would expect &amp;#39; in HTML source to be converted to an apostrophe in text, just as if I'd pasted the browser content into notepad.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong> <code>html2text</code> looks promising. It handles HTML entities correctly and ignores JavaScript.  However, it does not exactly produce plain text; it produces markdown that would then have to be turned into plain text. It comes with no examples or documentation, but the code looks clean.</p>

<ol>
<li>Identity integer column that auto increments.</li>
<li>Unique identifier (GUID)</li>
<li>A short character(x) or integer (or other relatively small numeric type) column that can serve as a row identifier column</li>
</ol>
<p>Number 3 would be used for fairly small lookup, mostly read tables that might have a unique static length string code, or a numeric value such as a year or other number.</p>
<p>For the most part, all other tables will either have an auto-incrementing integer or unique identifier primary key.</p>

<p><strong>When does type erasure occur?</strong> At compile time or runtime? When the class is loaded? When the class is instantiated?</p>

<p>A lot of sites (including the official tutorial mentioned above) say type erasure occurs at compile time. If the type information is completely removed at compile time, how does the JDK check type compatibility when a method using generics is invoked with no type information or wrong type information?</p>

<p>Consider the following example: Say class <code>A</code> has a method, <code>empty(Box&lt;?&nbsp;extends&nbsp;Number&gt;&nbsp;b)</code>. We compile <code>A.java</code> and get the class file <code>A.class</code>.</p>

<pre><code>public class A {
    public static void empty(Box&lt;? extends Number&gt; b) {}
}
</code></pre>



<pre><code>public class Box&lt;T&gt; {}
</code></pre>

<p>Now we create another class <code>B</code> which invokes the method <code>empty</code> with a non-parameterized argument (raw type): <code>empty(new Box())</code>. If we compile <code>B.java</code> with <code>A.class</code> in the classpath, javac is smart enough to raise a warning. So <code>A.class</code> <em>has</em> some type information stored in it.</p>

<pre><code>public class B {
    public static void invoke() {
        // java: unchecked method invocation:
        //  method empty in class A is applied to given types
        //  required: Box&lt;? extends java.lang.Number&gt;
        //  found:    Box
        // java: unchecked conversion
        //  required: Box&lt;? extends java.lang.Number&gt;
        //  found:    Box
        A.empty(new Box());
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>My guess would be that type erasure occurs when the class is loaded, but it is just a guess. So when does it happen? </p>

&lt;%= link_to('Text', thing_path(thing)) %&gt;
&lt;% else %&gt;

"345838","<p>With the help of the Stack Overflow community I've written a pretty basic-but fun physics simulator.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/EeqSP.png"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>You click and drag the mouse to launch a ball.  It will bounce around and eventually stop on the ""floor"".</p>

<p>My next big feature I want to add in is ball to ball collision.  The ball's movement is broken up into a x and y speed vector.  I have gravity (small reduction of the y vector each step), I have friction (small reduction of both vectors each collision with a wall). The balls honestly move around in a surprisingly realistic way.</p>

<p>I guess my question has two parts:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>What is the best method to detect ball to ball collision?</strong><br>
Do I just have an O(n^2) loop that iterates over each ball and checks every other ball to see if it's radius overlaps?</li>
<li><strong>What equations do I use to handle the ball to ball collisions? Physics 101</strong><br>
How does it effect the two balls speed x/y vectors?  What is the resulting direction the two balls head off in?  How do I apply this to each ball?</li>
</ol>

<p><img src=""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2c/Elastischer_sto%C3%9F_2D.gif"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>Handling the collision detection of the ""walls"" and the resulting vector changes were easy but I see more complications with ball-ball collisions.  With walls I simply had to take the negative of the appropriate x or y vector and off it would go in the correct direction.  With balls I don't think it is that way.</p>

<p>Some quick clarifications: for simplicity I'm ok with a perfectly elastic collision for now, also all my balls have the same mass right now, but I might change that in the future.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Success!</h2>

<p>I have the ball collision detection and response working great!</p>

<p>Relevant code:</p>

<p>Collision Detection:</p>

<pre><code>for (int i = 0; i &lt; ballCount; i++)  
{  
    for (int j = i + 1; j &lt; ballCount; j++)  
    {  
        if (balls[i].colliding(balls[j]))  
        {
            balls[i].resolveCollision(balls[j]);
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This will check for collisions between every ball but skip redundant checks (if you have to check if ball 1 collides with ball 2 then you don't need to check if ball 2 collides with ball 1.  Also, it skips checking for collisions with itself).</p>

<p>Then, in my ball class I have my colliding() and resolveCollision() methods:</p>

<pre><code>public boolean colliding(Ball ball)
{
    float xd = position.getX() - ball.position.getX();
    float yd = position.getY() - ball.position.getY();

    float sumRadius = getRadius() + ball.getRadius();
    float sqrRadius = sumRadius * sumRadius;

    float distSqr = (xd * xd) + (yd * yd);

    if (distSqr &lt;= sqrRadius)
    {
        return true;
    }

    return false;
}

public void resolveCollision(Ball ball)
{
    // get the mtd
    Vector2d delta = (position.subtract(ball.position));
    float d = delta.getLength();
    // minimum translation distance to push balls apart after intersecting
    Vector2d mtd = delta.multiply(((getRadius() + ball.getRadius())-d)/d); 


    // resolve intersection --
    // inverse mass quantities
    float im1 = 1 / getMass(); 
    float im2 = 1 / ball.getMass();

    // push-pull them apart based off their mass
    position = position.add(mtd.multiply(im1 / (im1 + im2)));
    ball.position = ball.position.subtract(mtd.multiply(im2 / (im1 + im2)));

    // impact speed
    Vector2d v = (this.velocity.subtract(ball.velocity));
    float vn = v.dot(mtd.normalize());

    // sphere intersecting but moving away from each other already
    if (vn &gt; 0.0f) return;

    // collision impulse
    float i = (-(1.0f + Constants.restitution) * vn) / (im1 + im2);
    Vector2d impulse = mtd.normalize().multiply(i);

    // change in momentum
    this.velocity = this.velocity.add(impulse.multiply(im1));
    ball.velocity = ball.velocity.subtract(impulse.multiply(im2));

}

<p>Here is how I use them:</p>

<p><strong>Fake</strong>: a class that implements an interface but contains fixed data and no logic.  Simply returns ""good"" or ""bad"" data depending on the implementation.</p>

<p><strong>Mock</strong>: a class that implements an interface and allows the ability to dynamically set the values to return/exceptions to throw from particular methods and provides the ability to check if particular methods have been called/not called.</p>

<p><strong>Stub</strong>: Like a mock class, except that it doesn't provide the ability to verify that methods have been called/not called.</p>

<p>Mocks and stubs can be hand generated or generated by a mocking framework.  Fake classes are generated by hand.  I use mocks primarily to verify interactions between my class and dependent classes.  I use stubs once I have verified the interactions and am testing alternate paths through my code.  I use fake classes primarily to abstract out data dependencies or when mocks/stubs are too tedious to set up each time.</p>

<p>With my helper function having the signature of <code>private ListNode reverse(ListNode current)</code>.</p>

<p>At the moment, I have it working iteratively using a stack, but this is not what the specification requires. I had found an algorithm in C that recursively reversed and converted it to Java code by hand, and it worked, but I had no understanding of it.</p>

<p>Edit: Nevermind, I figured it out in the meantime.</p>

<pre><code>private AddressList reverse(ListNode current, AddressList reversedList){
  if(current == null) 
      return reversedList;
  reversedList.addToFront(current.getData());
  return this.reverse(current.getNext(), reversedList);

"354883","<p>The canonical way to return multiple values in languages that support it is often <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38508/whats-the-best-way-to-return-multiple-values-from-a-function-in-python"">tupling</a>.</p>
<h3>Option: Using a tuple</h3>
<p>Consider this trivial example:</p>
<pre><code>def f(x):
  y0 = x + 1
  y1 = x * 3
  y2 = y0 ** y3
  return (y0, y1, y2)
</code></pre>
<p>However, this quickly gets problematic as the number of values returned increases. What if you want to return four or five values? Sure, you could keep tupling them, but it gets easy to forget which value is where. It's also rather ugly to unpack them wherever you want to receive them.</p>
<h3>Option: Using a dictionary</h3>
<p>The next logical step seems to be to introduce some sort of 'record notation'. In Python, the obvious way to do this is by means of a <code>dict</code>.</p>
<p>Consider the following:</p>
<pre><code>def g(x):
  y0 = x + 1
  y1 = x * 3
  y2 = y0 ** y3
  return {'y0': y0, 'y1': y1 ,'y2': y2}
</code></pre>
<p>(Just to be clear, y0, y1, and y2 are just meant as abstract identifiers. As pointed out, in practice you'd use meaningful identifiers.)</p>
<p>Now, we have a mechanism whereby we can project out a particular member of the returned object. For example,</p>
<pre><code>result['y0']
</code></pre>
<h3>Option: Using a class</h3>
<p>However, there is another option. We could instead return a specialized structure. I've framed this in the context of Python, but I'm sure it applies to other languages as well. Indeed, if you were working in C this might very well be your only option. Here goes:</p>
<pre><code>class ReturnValue:
  def __init__(self, y0, y1, y2):
     self.y0 = y0
     self.y1 = y1
     self.y2 = y2

def g(x):
  y0 = x + 1
  y1 = x * 3
  y2 = y0 ** y3
  return ReturnValue(y0, y1, y2)
</code></pre>
<p>In Python the previous two are perhaps very similar in terms of plumbing - after all <code>{ y0, y1, y2 }</code> just end up being entries in the internal <code>__dict__</code> of the <code>ReturnValue</code>.</p>
<p>There is one additional feature provided by Python though for tiny objects, the <code>__slots__</code> attribute. The class could be expressed as:</p>
<pre><code>class ReturnValue(object):
  __slots__ = [&quot;y0&quot;, &quot;y1&quot;, &quot;y2&quot;]
  def __init__(self, y0, y1, y2):
     self.y0 = y0
     self.y1 = y1
     self.y2 = y2
</code></pre>
<p>From the <a href=""http://www.network-theory.co.uk/docs/pylang/__slots__.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Python Reference Manual</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <code>__slots__</code> declaration takes a sequence of instance variables and reserves just enough space in each instance to hold a value for each variable. Space is saved because <code>__dict__</code> is not created for each instance.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Option: Using a <a href=""https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">dataclass</a> (Python 3.7+)</h3>
<p>Using Python 3.7's new dataclasses, return a class with automatically added special methods, typing and other useful tools:</p>
<pre><code>@dataclass
class Returnvalue:
    y0: int
    y1: float
    y3: int

def total_cost(x):
    y0 = x + 1
    y1 = x * 3
    y2 = y0 ** y3
    return ReturnValue(y0, y1, y2)
</code></pre>
<h3>Option: Using a list</h3>
<p>Another suggestion which I'd overlooked comes from Bill the Lizard:</p>
<pre><code>def h(x):
  result = [x + 1]
  result.append(x * 3)
  result.append(y0 ** y3)
  return result
</code></pre>
<p>This is my least favorite method though. I suppose I'm tainted by exposure to Haskell, but the idea of mixed-type lists has always felt uncomfortable to me. In this particular example the list is -not- mixed type, but it conceivably could be.</p>
<p>A list used in this way really doesn't gain anything with respect to the tuple as far as I can tell. The only real difference between lists and tuples in Python is that lists are <a href=""http://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html#typesseq-mutable"" rel=""noreferrer"">mutable</a>, whereas tuples are not.</p>
<p>I personally tend to carry over the conventions from functional programming: use lists for any number of elements of the same type, and tuples for a fixed number of elements of predetermined types.</p>

This has been reported to result in fewer merge conflicts without causing mis-merges by tests done on actual merge commits taken from Linux 2.6 kernel development history. Additionally this can detect and handle merges involving renames. This is the default merge strategy when pulling or merging one branch.</p></li>
<li><p><em>octopus</em> - 
This resolves more than two-head case, but refuses to do complex merge that needs manual resolution. It is primarily meant to be used for bundling topic branch heads together. This is the default merge strategy when pulling or merging more than one branches.</p></li>
<li><p><em>ours</em> - 
This resolves any number of heads, but the result of the merge is always the current branch head. It is meant to be used to supersede old development history of side branches.</p></li>
<li><p><em>subtree</em> - 
This is a modified recursive strategy. When merging trees A and B, if B corresponds to a subtree of A, B is first adjusted to match the tree structure of A, instead of reading the trees at the same level. This adjustment is also done to the common ancestor tree.</p></li>

However, <strong>when I load <code>someform.asp</code> as an IFRAME in IE 6 or IE 7, the cookies for example.com are not saved.</strong> In Firefox this problem doesn't appear.</p>

"390250","<p>When writing custom classes it is often important to allow equivalence by means of the <code>==</code> and <code>!=</code> operators. In Python, this is made possible by implementing the <code>__eq__</code> and <code>__ne__</code> special methods, respectively. The easiest way I've found to do this is the following method:</p>

<pre><code>class Foo:
    def __init__(self, item):
        self.item = item

    def __eq__(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, self.__class__):
            return self.__dict__ == other.__dict__
        else:
            return False

    def __ne__(self, other):
        return not self.__eq__(other)
</code></pre>

<p>Do you know of more elegant means of doing this? Do you know of any particular disadvantages to using the above method of comparing <code>__dict__</code>s?</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: A bit of clarification--when <code>__eq__</code> and <code>__ne__</code> are undefined, you'll find this behavior:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = Foo(1)
&gt;&gt;&gt; b = Foo(1)
&gt;&gt;&gt; a is b
False
&gt;&gt;&gt; a == b
False
</code></pre>

<p>That is, <code>a == b</code> evaluates to <code>False</code> because it really runs <code>a is b</code>, a test of identity (i.e., ""Is <code>a</code> the same object as <code>b</code>?"").</p>

<p>When <code>__eq__</code> and <code>__ne__</code> are defined, you'll find this behavior (which is the one we're after):</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = Foo(1)
&gt;&gt;&gt; b = Foo(1)
&gt;&gt;&gt; a is b
False
&gt;&gt;&gt; a == b
True

<p>I tried to flatten such a list with a nested list comprehension, like this:</p>

<pre><code>[image for image in menuitem for menuitem in list_of_menuitems]
</code></pre>

<p>But I get in trouble of the <code>NameError</code> variety there, because the <code>name 'menuitem' is not defined</code>.  After googling and looking around on Stack Overflow, I got the desired results with a <code>reduce</code> statement:</p>

<pre><code>reduce(list.__add__, map(lambda x: list(x), list_of_menuitems))
</code></pre>

<p>But this method is fairly unreadable because I need that <code>list(x)</code> call there because x is a Django <code>QuerySet</code> object.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>: </p>

<p>Thanks to everyone who contributed to this question.  Here is a summary of what I learned.  I'm also making this a community wiki in case others want to add to or correct these observations.</p>

<p>My original reduce statement is redundant and is better written this way:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; reduce(list.__add__, (list(mi) for mi in list_of_menuitems))
</code></pre>

<p>This is the correct syntax for a nested list comprehension (Brilliant summary <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/users/3002/df"">dF</a>!):</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; [image for mi in list_of_menuitems for image in mi]
</code></pre>

<p>But neither of these methods are as efficient as using <code>itertools.chain</code>:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; from itertools import chain
&gt;&gt;&gt; list(chain(*list_of_menuitems))
</code></pre>

<p>And as @cdleary notes, it's probably better style to avoid * operator magic by using <code>chain.from_iterable</code> like so:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; chain = itertools.chain.from_iterable([[1,2],[3],[5,89],[],[6]])
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(list(chain))

"407255","<p>I have always wondered if, in general, declaring a throw-away variable before a loop, as opposed to repeatedly inside the loop, makes any (performance) difference? 
A <em>(quite pointless)</em> example in Java:</p>

<p><strong>a)</strong> declaration before loop:</p>

<pre><code>double intermediateResult;
for(int i=0; i &lt; 1000; i++){
    intermediateResult = i;
    System.out.println(intermediateResult);
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>b)</strong> declaration (repeatedly) inside loop:</p>

<pre><code>for(int i=0; i &lt; 1000; i++){
    double intermediateResult = i;
    System.out.println(intermediateResult);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Which one is better, <strong>a</strong> or <strong>b</strong>? </p>

<p>I suspect that repeated variable declaration (example <strong>b</strong>) creates more overhead <em>in theory</em>, but that compilers are smart enough so that it doesn't matter. Example <strong>b</strong> has the advantage of being more compact and limiting the scope of the variable to where it is used. Still, I tend to code according example <strong>a</strong>.</p>

"409563","<p>I'm stuck deciding how to handle exceptions in my application. </p>

<p>Much if my issues with exceptions comes from 1) accessing data via a remote service or 2) deserializing a JSON object. Unfortunately I can't guarantee success for either of these tasks (cut network connection, malformed JSON object that is out of my control). </p>

<p>As a result, if I do encounter an exception I simply catch it within the function and return FALSE to the caller. My logic is that all the caller really cares about is if the task was successful, not why it is wasn't successful.</p>

<p>Here's some sample code (in JAVA) of a typical method)</p>

<pre><code>public boolean doSomething(Object p_somthingToDoOn)
{
    boolean result = false;

    try{
        // if dirty object then clean
        doactualStuffOnObject(p_jsonObject);

        //assume success (no exception thrown)
        result = true;
    }
    catch(Exception Ex)
    {
        //don't care about exceptions
        Ex.printStackTrace();
    }
    return result;
}
</code></pre>

<p>I think this approach is fine, but I'm really curious to know what the best practices are for managing exceptions (should I really bubble an exception all the way up a call stack?). </p>

<p><strong>In summary of key questions:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Is it okay to just catch exceptions but not bubble them up or formally notifying the system (either via a log or a notification to the user)?</li>
<li>What best practices are there for exceptions that don't result in everything requiring a try/catch block?</li>
</ol>

<p>It seems that exception management is one of those things that vary based on context. But most importantly, one should be consistent in how they manage exceptions within a system. </p>

<p>Additionally watch out for code-rot via excessive try/catches or not giving a exception its respect (an exception is warning the system, what else needs to be warned?).</p>

<p>From this comment it brings up some questions to think about when dealing with exceptions:</p>

<ul>
<li>What is the point this exception being thrown?</li>
<li>How does it make sense to handle it? </li>
<li>Does the caller really care about the exception or do they just care if the call was successful?</li>
<li>Is forcing a caller to manage a potential exception graceful?</li>
<li><strong><em>Are you being respectful to the idoms of the language?</em></strong> 

<ul>
<li>Do you really need to return a success flag like boolean? Returning boolean (or an int) is more of a C mindset than a Java (in Java you would just handle the exception) one. </li>

<p>Situation is quite simple - server is the central node, that multiple clients connect to and manipulate same data.

<p>Below is how i now think to solve it:
Parallel to data, a modification journal will be held, having all transactions timestamped. 
When client connects, it receives all changes since last check, in consolidated form (server goes through lists and removes additions that are followed by deletions, merges updates for each atom, etc.).
Et voila, we are up to date.</p>

<p>Basically I want to update three out of four columns if the record exists, 
If it does not exists I want to INSERT the record with the default (NUL) value for the fourth column.</p>

<p>The ID is a primary key so there will only ever be one record to UPSERT.</p>

<hr>

<p>I cannot confirm that Syntax on the SQLite site for TABLE CREATE.
I have not built a demo to test it, but It doesnt seem to be supported..</p>

<p>If it was, I have three columns so it would actually look like:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE table1( 
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY ON CONFLICT REPLACE, 
    Blob1 BLOB ON CONFLICT REPLACE, 
    Blob2 BLOB ON CONFLICT REPLACE, 
    Blob3 BLOB

So I asusme Blob1 and Blob2 would not be replaced (as desired)</p>

<p>UPDATEs in SQLite when binding data are a complete transaction, meaning 
Each sent row to be updated requires:  Prepare/Bind/Step/Finalize statements

<ol>
<li>Create the object using sqlite3_prepare_v2() </li>
<li>Bind values to host parameters using sqlite3_bind_ interfaces.</li>

<li>Reset the statement using sqlite3_reset() then go back to step 2 and repeat.</li>
<li>Destroy the statement object using sqlite3_finalize().</li>

<p>UPDATE I am guessing is slow compared to INSERT, but how does it compare to SELECT using the Primary key?</p>

"420843","<p>I'm having some trouble understanding the purpose of a salt to a password.  It's my understanding that the primary use is to hamper a rainbow table attack.  However, the methods I've seen to implement this don't seem to really make the problem harder.</p>

<p>I've seen many tutorials suggesting that the salt be used as the following:</p>

<pre><code>$hash =  md5($salt.$password)
</code></pre>

<p>The reasoning being that the hash now maps not to the original password, but a combination of the password and the salt.  But say <code>$salt=foo</code> and <code>$password=bar</code> and <code>$hash=3858f62230ac3c915f300c664312c63f</code>.  Now somebody with a rainbow table could reverse the hash and come up with the input ""foobar"".  They could then try all combinations of passwords (f, fo, foo, ... oobar, obar, bar, ar, ar).  It might take a few more milliseconds to get the password, but not much else.</p>

<p>The other use I've seen is on my linux system.  In the /etc/shadow the hashed passwords are actually stored <em>with</em> the salt.  For example, a salt of ""foo"" and password of ""bar"" would hash to this: <code>$1$foo$te5SBM.7C25fFDu6bIRbX1</code>.  If a hacker somehow were able to get his hands on this file, I don't see what purpose the salt serves, since the reverse hash of <code>te5SBM.7C25fFDu6bIRbX</code> is known to contain ""foo"".</p>

<p>Thanks for any light anybody can shed on this.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>:  Thanks for the help.  To summarize what I understand, the salt makes the hashed password more complex, thus making it much less likely to exist in a precomputed rainbow table.  What I misunderstood before was that I was assuming a rainbow table existed for ALL hashes.</p>

<p>The problem however is that I need the word ""FORMS"" when I ask for AuthenticationMethod.FORMS and not the id 1.</p>

<p>I have found the following solution for this problem (<a href=""http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/11130/String-Enumerations-in-C"" rel=""noreferrer"">link</a>):</p>

        _value = value;
    }

    public string Value
    {

    }

}
</code></pre>

<p>Then I can add this attribute to my enumerator:</p>

<pre><code>public enum AuthenticationMethod
{
    [StringValue(""FORMS"")]
    FORMS = 1,
    [StringValue(""WINDOWS"")]
    WINDOWSAUTHENTICATION = 2,
    [StringValue(""SSO"")]
    SINGLESIGNON = 3
}
</code></pre>

<p>And of course I need something to retrieve that StringValue:</p>

<pre><code>public static class StringEnum
{
    public static string GetStringValue(Enum value)
    {
        string output = null;
        Type type = value.GetType();

        //Check first in our cached results...

        //Look for our 'StringValueAttribute' 

        //in the field's custom attributes

        FieldInfo fi = type.GetField(value.ToString());
        StringValue[] attrs =
           fi.GetCustomAttributes(typeof(StringValue),
                                   false) as StringValue[];
        if (attrs.Length &gt; 0)
        {
            output = attrs[0].Value;
        }

        return output;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Good now I've got the tools to get a string value for an enumerator.
I can then use it like this:</p>

<pre><code>string valueOfAuthenticationMethod = StringEnum.GetStringValue(AuthenticationMethod.FORMS);
</code></pre>

<p>I mean, they probably have real-world data in some form, certainly including distances but also perhaps things like driving speeds, presence of sidewalks, train schedules, etc.  But suppose the data were in a simpler format, say a very large directed graph with edge weights reflecting distances.  I want to be able to quickly compute directions from one arbitrary point to another.  Sometimes these points will be close together (within one city) while sometimes they will be far apart (cross-country).</p>

<p>Graph algorithms like Dijkstra's algorithm will not work because the graph is enormous.  Luckily, heuristic algorithms like A* will probably work.  However, our data is very structured, and perhaps some kind of tiered approach might work?  (For example, store precomputed directions between certain ""key"" points far apart, as well as some local directions.  Then directions for two far-away points will involve local directions to a key points, global directions to another key point, and then local directions again.)</p>

<p>What algorithms are actually used in practice?</p>

<p>PS.  This question was motivated by finding quirks in online mapping directions.

<li>moving the query to a view, and selecting from the view is fast</li>
<li>selecting from the view from a stored procedure is 40x slower?</li>
</ul>

<p>I tried moving the definition of the view directly into the stored procedure (violating 3 business rules, and breaking an important encapsulation), and that makes it only about 6x slower.</p>

<p>Why is the stored procedure version so slow? What can possibly account for SQL Server running ad-hoc SQL faster than a different kind of ad-hoc SQL? </p>

<hr>

<p>My next attempt will be to have <code>StoredProcedureA</code> call <code>StoredProcedureB</code> call <code>StoredProcedureC</code> call <code>StoredProcedureD</code> to query the view.</p>

<p>And failing that, have the stored procedure call a stored procedure, call a UDF, call a UDF, call a stored procedure, call a UDF to query the view.</p>

<p>Some of the given reasons are:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/416183/in-java-critical-sections-what-should-i-synchronize-on#416198"">some <em>evil code</em> may steal your lock</a> (very popular this one, also has an ""accidentally"" variant)</li>
<li><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/309631/what-cases-require-synchronized-method-access-in-java#309677"">all synchronized methods within the same class use the exact same lock, which reduces throughput</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/439302/allowing-a-method-to-lock-its-parent-object-in-java#439317"">you are (unnecessarily) exposing too much information</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Other people, including me, argue that <code>synchronized(this)</code> is an idiom that is used a lot (also in Java libraries), is safe and well understood. It should not be avoided because you have a bug and you don't have a clue of what is going on in your multithreaded program. In other words: if it is applicable, then use it.</p>

<p>I am interested in seeing some real-world examples (no foobar stuff) where avoiding a lock on <code>this</code> is preferable when <code>synchronized(this)</code> would also do the job.</p>

<p>Therefore: <strong>should you always avoid <code>synchronized(this)</code> and replace it with a lock on a private reference?</strong>  </p>

<hr>

<p>Some further info (updated as answers are given):</p>

<ul>
<li>we are talking about instance synchronization</li>
<li>both implicit (<code>synchronized</code> methods) and explicit form of <code>synchronized(this)</code> are considered</li>
<li>if you quote Bloch or other authorities on the subject, don't leave out the parts you don't like (e.g. Effective Java, item on Thread Safety: <em>Typically it is the lock on the instance itself, but there are exceptions.)</em></li>
<li>if you need granularity in your locking other than <code>synchronized(this)</code> provides, then <code>synchronized(this)</code> is not applicable so that's not the issue</li>

<p>I've accepted an answer, but sadly, I believe we're stuck with our original worst case scenario: <strong>CAPTCHA everyone on purchase attempts of the crap</strong>. Short explanation: caching / web farms make it impossible to track hits, and any workaround (sending a non-cached web-beacon, writing to a unified table, etc.) slows the site down worse than the bots would. There is likely some pricey hardware from Cisco or the like that can help at a high level, but it's hard to justify the cost if CAPTCHA-ing everyone is an alternative. I'll attempt a more full explanation later, as well as cleaning this up for future searchers (though others are welcome to try, as it's community wiki).</p>

<h2>Situation</h2>
<p>This is about the bag o' crap sales on woot.com. I'm the president of Woot Workshop, the subsidiary of Woot that does the design, writes the product descriptions, podcasts, blog posts, and moderates the forums. I work with CSS/HTML and am only barely familiar with other technologies. I work closely with the developers and have talked through all of the answers here (and many other ideas we've had).</p>
<p>Usability is a massive part of my job, and making the site exciting and fun is most of the rest of it. That's where the three goals below derive. CAPTCHA harms usability, and bots steal the fun and excitement out of our crap sales.</p>
<p>Bots are slamming our front page tens of times a second screen scraping (and/or scanning our RSS) for the Random Crap sale. The moment they see that, it triggers a second stage of the program that logs in, clicks I want One, fills out the form, and buys the crap.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>On Woot, anonymous (non-logged) users can view our home page. In other words, the slamming bots can be non-authenticated (and essentially non-trackable except by IP address).</p>
<p>So we're back to scanning for IPs, which a) is fairly useless in this age of cloud networking and spambot zombies and b) catches too many innocents given the number of businesses that come from one IP address (not to mention the issues with non-static IP ISPs and potential performance hits to trying to track this).</p>

Our problem is bots are built specifically to defeat our site. Some of these methods could likely work for a short time until the scripters evolved their bots to ignore the honeypot, screen-scrape for nearby label names instead of form ids, and use a javascript-capable browser control.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The rest of the responses generally rely on IP tracking, which, again, seems to both be useless (with botnets/zombies/cloud networking) and detrimental (catching many innocents who come from same-IP destinations).</p>
<p>Any other approaches / ideas? My developers keep saying &quot;let's just do CAPTCHA&quot; but I'm hoping there's less intrusive methods to all actual humans wanting some of our crap.</p>
<h2>Original question</h2>
<p>Say you're selling something cheap that has a very high perceived value, and you have a very limited amount. No one knows exactly when you will sell this item. And over a million people regularly come by to see what you're selling.</p>
<p>You end up with scripters and bots attempting to programmatically [a] figure out when you're selling said item, and [b] make sure they're among the first to buy it. This sucks for two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Your site is slammed by non-humans, slowing everything down for everyone.</li>
<li>The scripters end up 'winning' the product, causing the regulars to feel cheated.</li>
</ol>
<p>A seemingly obvious solution is to create some hoops for your users to jump through before placing their order, but there are at least three problems with this:</p>
<ul>
<li>The user experience sucks for humans, as they have to decipher CAPTCHA, pick out the cat, or solve a math problem.</li>
<li>If the perceived benefit is high enough, and the crowd large enough, some group will find their way around any tweak, leading to an arms race. (This is especially true the simpler the tweak is; hidden 'comments' form, re-arranging the form elements, mis-labeling them, hidden 'gotcha' text all will work once and then need to be changed to fight targeting this specific form.)</li>
<li>Even if the scripters can't 'solve' your tweak it doesn't prevent them from slamming your front page, and then sounding an alarm for the scripter to fill out the order, manually. Given they get the advantage from solving [a], they will likely still win [b] since they'll be the first humans reaching the order page. Additionally, 1. still happens, causing server errors and a decreased performance for everyone.</li>
</ul>
<p>Another solution is to watch for IPs hitting too often, block them from the firewall, or otherwise prevent them from ordering. This could solve 2. and prevent [b] but the performance hit from scanning for IPs is massive and would likely cause more problems like 1. than the scripters were causing on their own. Additionally, the possibility of cloud networking and spambot zombies makes IP checking fairly useless.</p>
<p>A third idea, forcing the order form to be loaded for some time (say, half a second) would potentially slow the progress of the speedy orders, but again, the scripters would still be the first people in, at any speed not detrimental to actual users.</p>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<ol>
<li>Sell the item to non-scripting humans.</li>
<li>Keep the site running at a speed not slowed by bots.</li>
<li>Don't hassle the 'normal' users with any tasks to complete to prove they're human.</li>

"457927","<p>I've been using Git now for a couple of months on a project with one other developer. I have several years of experience with <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Subversion"" rel=""noreferrer"">SVN</a>, so I guess I bring a lot of baggage to the relationship.</p>

<p>I have heard that Git is excellent for branching and merging, and so far, I just don't see it. Sure, branching is dead simple, but when I try to merge, everything goes all to hell. Now, I'm used to that from SVN, but it seems to me that I just traded one sub-par versioning system for another.</p>

<p>My partner tells me that my problems stem from my desire to merge willy-nilly, and that I should be using rebase instead of merge in many situations. For example, here's the workflow that he's laid down:</p>

<pre><code>clone the remote repository
git checkout -b my_new_feature
..work and commit some stuff
git rebase master
..work and commit some stuff
git rebase master
..finish the feature
git checkout master
git merge my_new_feature
</code></pre>

<p>Essentially, create a feature branch, ALWAYS rebase from master to the branch, and merge from the branch back to master. Important to note is that the branch always stays local.</p>

<p>Here is the workflow that I started with</p>

<pre><code>clone remote repository
create my_new_feature branch on remote repository
git checkout -b --track my_new_feature origin/my_new_feature
..work, commit, push to origin/my_new_feature
git merge master (to get some changes that my partner added)
..work, commit, push to origin/my_new_feature
git merge master
..finish my_new_feature, push to origin/my_new_feature
git checkout master
git merge my_new_feature
delete remote branch
delete local branch
</code></pre>

<p>There are two essential differences (I think): I use merge always instead of rebasing, and I push my feature branch (and my feature branch commits) to the remote repository.</p>

<p>My reasoning for the remote branch is that I want my work backed up as I'm working. Our repository is automatically backed up and can be restored if something goes wrong. My laptop is not, or not as thoroughly. Therefore, I hate to have code on my laptop that's not mirrored somewhere else.</p>

<p>My reasoning for the merge instead of rebase is that merge seems to be standard and rebase seems to be an advanced feature. My gut feeling is that what I'm trying to do is not an advanced setup, so rebase should be unnecessary. I've even perused the new Pragmatic Programming book on Git, and they cover merge extensively and barely mention rebase.</p>

<p>Anyway, I was following my workflow on a recent branch, and when I tried to merge it back to master, it all went to hell. There were tons of conflicts with things that should have not mattered. The conflicts just made no sense to me. It took me a day to sort everything out, and eventually culminated in a forced push to the remote master, since my local master has all conflicts resolved, but the remote one still wasn't happy.</p>

<p>What is the ""correct"" workflow for something like this? Git is supposed to make branching and merging super-easy, and I'm just not seeing it.</p>

<p><strong>Update 2011-04-15</strong></p>

<p>This seems to be a very popular question, so I thought I'd update with my two years experience since I first asked.</p>

<p>It turns out that the original workflow is correct, at least in our case. In other words, this is what we do and it works:</p>

<pre><code>clone the remote repository
git checkout -b my_new_feature
..work and commit some stuff
git rebase master
..work and commit some stuff
git rebase master
..finish the feature, commit
git rebase master
git checkout master
git merge my_new_feature
</code></pre>

<p>In fact, our workflow is a little different, as we tend to do <em>squash merges</em> instead of raw merges. (<strong>Note: This is controversial, see below.</strong>) This allows us to turn our entire feature branch into a single commit on master. Then we delete our feature branch. This allows us to logically structure our commits on master, even if they're a little messy on our branches. So, this is what we do:</p>

<pre><code>clone the remote repository
git checkout -b my_new_feature
..work and commit some stuff
git rebase master
..work and commit some stuff
git rebase master
..finish the feature, commit
git rebase master
git checkout master
git merge --squash my_new_feature
git commit -m ""added my_new_feature""
git branch -D my_new_feature
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Squash Merge Controversy</strong> - As several commenters have pointed out, the squash merge will throw away all history on your feature branch. As the name implies, it squashes all the commits down into a single one. For small features, this makes sense as it condenses it down into a single package. For larger features, it's probably not a great idea, especially if your individual commits are already atomic. It really comes down to personal preference.</p>

<p><strong>Github and Bitbucket (others?) Pull Requests</strong> - In case you're wondering how merge/rebase relates to Pull Requests, I recommend following all the above steps up until you're ready to merge back to master. Instead of manually merging with git, you just accept the PR. Note that this will not do a squash merge (at least not by default), but non-squash, non-fast-forward is the accepted merge convention in the Pull Request community (as far as I know). Specifically, it works like this:</p>

<pre><code>clone the remote repository
git checkout -b my_new_feature
..work and commit some stuff
git rebase master
..work and commit some stuff
git rebase master
..finish the feature, commit
git rebase master
git push # May need to force push
...submit PR, wait for a review, make any changes requested for the PR
git rebase master
git push # Will probably need to force push (-f), due to previous rebases from master
...accept the PR, most likely also deleting the feature branch in the process
git checkout master
git branch -d my_new_feature
git remote prune origin
</code></pre>

<p>Background: I have a photo album website, and every image uploaded is renamed to an 8-hex-digit id (say, a58f375c.jpg).  This is to avoid filename conflicts (if lots of ""IMG0001.JPG"" files are uploaded, for example).  The original filename and any useful metadata is stored in a database.  Right now, I have somewhere around 1500 files in the images directory.  This makes listing the files in the directory (through FTP or SSH client) take a few seconds.  But I can't see that it has any effect other than that.  In particular, there doesn't seem to be any impact on how quickly an image file is served to the user.</p>

<p>I've thought about reducing the number of images by making 16 subdirectories: 0-9 and a-f.  Then I'd move the images into the subdirectories based on what the first hex digit of the filename was.

"477572","<p>I have a list view with a couple of image buttons on each row. When you click the list row, it launches a new activity. I have had to build my own tabs because of an issue with the camera layout. The activity that gets launched for the result is a map.

<p>The image preview on the list view is being done with the cursor and <code>ListAdapter</code>. This makes it pretty simple, but I am not sure how I can put a resized image (I.e. Smaller bit size not pixel as the <code>src</code> for the image button on the fly. So I just resized the image that came off the phone camera.</p>

"479233","<p>First, a little background: It is no secret that I am implementing an auth+auth system for CodeIgniter, and so far I'm winning (so to speak). But I've run into a pretty non-trivial challenge (one that most auth libraries miss entirely, but I insist on handling it properly): how to deal intelligently with <strong>large-scale, distributed, variable-username brute-force attacks</strong>.</p>

<p>I know all the usual tricks:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Limiting # of failed attempts per IP/host</strong> and denying the offenders access (e.g. Fail2Ban) - which no longer works <a href=""http://www.christopher-kunz.de/archives/205-Distributed-and-coordinated-SSH-bruteforce-attacks.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">since botnets have grown smarter</a></li>
<li>Combining the above with a <strong>blacklist of known 'bad' IPs/hosts</strong> (e.g. DenyHosts) - which relies on botnets falling for #1, <a href=""http://www.christopher-kunz.de/archives/205-Distributed-and-coordinated-SSH-bruteforce-attacks.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">which they increasingly don't</a></li>
<li><strong>IP/host whitelists</strong> combined with traditional auth (sadly useless with dynamic IP users and the high churn on most web sites)</li>
<li>Setting a <strong>sitewide limit</strong> on # of failed attempts within a N minute/hour period, and throttling (suspending) all login attempts after that for a number of minutes/hours (with the problem that DoS attacking you becomes botnet child's play)</li>
<li>Mandatory <strong>digital signatures</strong> (public-key certificates) or RSA hardware tokens for all users with NO login/password option (without question a rock-solid solution, but only practical for closed, dedicated services)</li>
<li>Enforced <strong>ultra-strong password schemes</strong> (e.g. >25 nonsense characters with symbols - again, too impractical for casual users)</li>
<li>And finally, <strong>CAPTCHAs</strong> (which could work in most cases, but are annoying for users and <a href=""http://caca.zoy.org/wiki/PWNtcha"" rel=""noreferrer"">virtually useless</a> against a <a href=""http://www.slideshare.net/valicac/captcha"" rel=""noreferrer"">determined, resourceful attacker</a>)</li>
</ol>

<p>Now, these are just the theoretically workable ideas. There are <em>plenty</em> of rubbish ideas that blow the site wide open (e.g. to trivial DoS attacks). What I want is something better. And by better, I mean:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>It has to be secure(+) against DoS and brute-force attacks, and not introduce any new vulnerabilities that might allow a slightly sneakier bot to continue operating under the radar</p></li>
<li><p>It has to be automated. If it requires a human operator to verify each login or monitor suspicious activity, it's not going to work in a real-world scenario</p></li>
<li><p>It has to be feasible for mainstream web use (ie. high churn, high volume, and open registration that can be performed by non-programmers)</p></li>
<li><p>It can't impede the user experience to the point where casual users will get annoyed or frustrated (and potentially abandon the site)</p></li>
<li><p>It can't involve kittens, unless they are <em>really really secure</em> kittens</p></li>
</ul>

<p>(+) <em>By 'secure', I mean at least as secure as a paranoid user's ability to keep his password secret</em></p>

<p>So - let's hear it! <em>How would you do it</em>? Do you know of a best-practice that I haven't mentioned (oh please say you do)? I admit I do have an idea of my own (combining ideas from 3 and 4), but I'll let the true experts speak before embarrassing myself ;-)</p>

<p>By ""proper"" I mean that if my parent element is <code>200px</code> tall and I specify <code>height = 100%</code> with <code>padding = 5px</code> I would expect that I should get a <code>190px</code> high element with <code>border = 5px</code> on all sides, nicely centered in the parent element.</p>

<p>Can anyone suggest others? How much improvement would caching on low-traffic sites?</p>

<p>Edit: Thanks for the tips so far. Any suggestions how to discover what's using up the memory? Are there any guides to Python memory profiling?</p>

<p>Also as mentioned there's a few things that will make it tricky to switch to mod_wsgi so I'd like to have some idea of the gains I could expect before ploughing forwards in that direction. </p>

<p><b>Edit:</b> <a href=""http://blog.dscpl.com.au/2009/03/load-spikes-and-excessive-memory-usage.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Graham Dumpleton's article</a> is the best I've found on the MPM and mod_wsgi related stuff. I am rather disappointed that no-one could provide any info on debugging the memory usage in the app itself though. </p>

<p><b>Final Edit:</b> Well I have been discussing this with Webfaction to see if they could assist with recompiling Apache and this is their word on the matter:</p>

<blockquote>""I really don't think that you will get much of a benefit by switching to an MPM Worker + mod_wsgi setup.  I estimate that you might be able to save around 20MB, but probably not much more than that.""</blockquote>

<p>So! This brings me back to my original question (which I am still none the wiser about). How does one go about identifying where the problems lies? It's a well known maxim that you don't optimize without testing to see where you need to optimize but there is very little in the way of tutorials on measuring Python memory usage and none at all specific to Django.</p>

I never encounter a problem where I think, ""Hmm...this looks like a job for a decorator!""</p>

"490420","<p>If you had to choose your <strong>Favorite</strong> (clever) techniques for defensive coding, what would they be?  Although my current languages are Java and Objective-C (with a background in C++), feel free to answer in any language.  Emphasis here would be on <em>clever</em> defensive techniques other than those that 70%+ of us here already know about.  So now it is time to dig deep into your bag of tricks.</p>

<p>In other words try to think of other than this <strong>uninteresting</strong> example:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>if(5 == x)</code> <strong>instead of</strong> <code>if(x == 5)</code>:  to avoid unintended assignment</li>
</ul>

<p>Here are some examples of some <strong>intriguing</strong> best defensive programming practices (language-specific examples are in Java):</p>

<p><strong>- Lock down your variables until you know that you need to change them</strong></p>

<p>That is, you can declare <em>all</em> variables <code>final</code> until you know that you will need to change it, at which point you can remove the <code>final</code>. One commonly unknown fact is that this is also valid for method params:</p>

<pre><code>public void foo(final int arg) { /* Stuff Here */ }
</code></pre>

<p><strong>- When something bad happens, leave a trail of evidence behind</strong></p>

<p>There are a number of things you can do when you have an exception: obviously logging it and performing some cleanup would be a few.  But you can also leave a trail of evidence (e.g. setting variables to sentinel values like ""UNABLE TO LOAD FILE"" or 99999 would be useful in the debugger, in case you happen to blow past an exception <code>catch</code>-block).</p>

<p><strong>- When it comes to consistency: the devil is in the details</strong></p>

<p>Be as consistent with the other libraries that you are using.  For example, in Java, if you are creating a method that extracts a range of values make the lower bound <em>inclusive</em> and the upper bound <em>exclusive</em>.  This will make it consistent with methods like <code>String.substring(start, end)</code> which operates in the same way.  You'll find all of these type of methods in the Sun JDK to behave this way as it makes various operations including iteration of elements consistent with arrays, where the indices are from Zero (<em>inclusive</em>) to the length of the array (<em>exclusive</em>). </p>

This question is similar but not quite the same <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/454868/handling-dialogs-in-wpf-with-mvvm"">as this one (handling-dialogs-in-wpf-with-mvvm)</a>...</p>
<p>I have a &quot;Login&quot; form written using the MVVM pattern.</p>
<p>This form has a ViewModel which holds the Username and Password, which are bound to the view in the XAML using normal data bindings.
It also has a &quot;Login&quot; command which is bound to the &quot;Login&quot; button on the form, agan using normal databinding.</p>
<p>When the &quot;Login&quot; command fires, it invokes a function in the ViewModel which goes off and sends data over the network to log in. When this function completes, there are 2 actions:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The login was invalid - we just show a MessageBox and all is fine</p>
</li>
<li><p>The login was valid, we need to close the Login form and have it return true as its <code>DialogResult</code>...</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The problem is, the ViewModel knows nothing about the actual view, so how can it close the view and tell it to return a particular DialogResult?? I could stick some code in the CodeBehind, and/or pass the View through to the ViewModel, but that seems like it would defeat the whole point of MVVM entirely...</p>
<hr />
<h3>Update</h3>
<p>In the end I just violated the &quot;purity&quot; of the MVVM pattern and had the View publish a <code>Closed</code> event, and expose a <code>Close</code> method. The ViewModel would then just call <code>view.Close</code>. The view is only known via an interface and wired up via an IOC container, so no testability or maintainability is lost.</p>
<p>It seems rather silly that the accepted answer is at -5 votes! While I'm well aware of the good feelings that one gets by solving a problem while being &quot;pure&quot;, Surely I'm not the only one that thinks that 200 lines of events, commands and behaviors just to avoid a one line method in the name of &quot;patterns&quot; and &quot;purity&quot; is a bit ridiculous....</p>

<p>Problem was elsewhere when you tried to use the hash you'd get warnings:</p>

<p>To me, ""unmanaged"" means things like database connections, sockets, window handles, etc.  But, I've seen code where the <code>Dispose()</code> method is implemented to free <em>managed</em> resources, which seems redundant to me, since the garbage collector should take care of that for you.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>public class MyCollection : IDisposable
{
    private List&lt;String&gt; _theList = new List&lt;String&gt;();
    private Dictionary&lt;String, Point&gt; _theDict = new Dictionary&lt;String, Point&gt;();

        _theDict.clear();
        _theList = null;
        _theDict = null;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>My question is, does this make the garbage collector free memory used by <code>MyCollection</code> any faster than it normally would?</p>

<p><strong>edit</strong>:  So far people have posted some good examples of using IDisposable to clean up unmanaged resources such as database connections and bitmaps.  But suppose that <code>_theList</code> in the above code contained a million strings, and you wanted to free that memory <em>now</em>, rather than waiting for the garbage collector.

The answer apparently is not simple due to memory managment issues. <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/134575/using-interface-builder-for-uitableviews"">This thread</a> mentions the issue and suggests a solution, but is pre NDA-release and lacks code. Here's a <a href=""http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?messageID=8040526&amp;tstart=0"" rel=""noreferrer"">long thread</a> that discusses the issue without providing a definitive answer. </p>

<pre><code>static NSString *CellIdentifier = @""MyCellIdentifier"";

MyCell *cell = (MyCell *)[tableView dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifier:CellIdentifier];
if (cell == nil) {
    NSArray *nib = [[NSBundle mainBundle] loadNibNamed:CellIdentifier owner:self options:nil];
    cell = (MyCell *)[nib objectAtIndex:0];
}
</code></pre>

<p>To use this code, create MyCell.m/.h, a new subclass of <code>UITableViewCell</code> and add <code>IBOutlets</code> for the components you want. Then create a new ""Empty XIB"" file. Open the Xib file in IB, add a <code>UITableViewCell</code> object, set its identifier to ""MyCellIdentifier"", and set its class to MyCell and add your components. Finally, connect the <code>IBOutlets</code> to the components. Note that we did not set the File's Owner in IB.</p>

<p>Other methods advocate setting the File's Owner and warn of memory leaks if the Xib is not loaded via an additional factory class. I tested the above under Instruments/Leaks and saw no memory leaks. </p>

<p>So what's the canonical way to load cells from Xibs? Do we set File's Owner? Do we need a factory? If so, what's the code for the factory look like? If there are multiple solutions, let's clarify the pros and cons of each of them...</p>

These two things together mean that you'll have lots of interfaces with a single POJO implementation.</p>

<p>So, I guess my question boils down to: <strong>""Is it worth following the broader Interface naming convention especially in light of where Java Frameworks seem to be heading?""</strong></p>

<li>Google JSAPI</li>
<li>jQuery's site</li>
<li>your own site/server</li>
<li>another CDN</li>
</ul>

<p>I have recently been using Google JSAPI, but have found that it takes a long time to setup an SSL connection or even only to resolve google.com. I have been using the following for Google:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script src=""https://www.google.com/jsapi""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
google.load('jquery', '1.3.1');
&lt;/script&gt;

<p>I like the idea of using Google so it's cached when visiting other sites and to save bandwidth from our server, but if it keeps being the slow portion of the site, I may change the include.</p>

<p>What do you use? Have you had any issues?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Just visited jQuery's site and they use the following method:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type=""text/javascript"" src=""http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.3/jquery.min.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

<p><strong>Edit2:</strong> Here's how I've been including jQuery without any problems for the last year:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script src=""//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.4.3/jquery.min.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

<p>One of the resources I'm using is Stanford's CS193P class notes that they have left on the web.  It includes lecture notes, assignments and sample code, and since the course was given by Apple dev's, I definitely consider it to be ""from the horse's mouth"".</p>

<p>Lecture 08 is related to an assignment to build a UINavigationController based app that has multiple UIViewControllers pushed onto the UINavigationController stack.  That's how the UINavigationController works.  That's logical.  However, there are some stern warnings in the slide about communicating between your UIViewControllers.</p>

<p>I'm going to quote from this serious of slides:<br>
<a href=""http://cs193p.stanford.edu/downloads/08-NavigationTabBarControllers.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://cs193p.stanford.edu/downloads/08-NavigationTabBarControllers.pdf</a></p>

  <li>Direct dependencies make your code less reusable
  
  <ul>
  <li>And more difficult to debug &amp; test</li>
  </ul></li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Ok.  I'm down with that.  Don't blindly toss all your methods that will be used for communicating between the viewcontroller into your app delegate and reference the viewcontroller instances in the app delegate methods.  Fair 'nuff.</p>

<p>A bit further on, we get this slide telling us what we <em>should</em> do.</p>

<p>Page 18/51:</p>

<blockquote>
  <h1>Best Practices for Data Flow</h1>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Figure out <strong>exactly</strong> what needs to be communicated</li>
  <li><strong>Define input parameters</strong> for your view controller</li>
  <li>For communicating back up the hierarchy, <strong>use loose coupling</strong>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Define a generic interface for observers (like delegation)</li>
  </ul></li>

<p>Ok, so... I'm afraid my objc-fu is not so strong.  I'm also a bit confused by the final line in the above quote.  I've been doing my fair share of googling about this and I found what appears to be a decent article talking about the various methods of Observing/Notification techniques:<br>

<p>Method #5 even indicates delegates as an method!  Except.... objects can only set one delegate at a time.  So when I have multiple viewcontroller communication, what am I to do?</p>

<p>Ok, that's the set up gang.  I know I can easily do my communication methods in the app delegate by reference's the multiple viewcontroller instances in my appdelegate but I want to do this sort of thing the <em>right</em> way.</p>

<p>Please help me ""do the right thing"" by answering the following questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>When I am trying to push a new viewcontroller on the UINavigationController stack, <strong>who</strong> should be doing this push.  <strong>Which</strong> class/file in my code is the correct place?</li>
<li>When I want to affect some piece of data (value of an iVar) in one of my UIViewControllers when I am in a <strong>different</strong> UIViewController, what is the ""right"" way to do this?</li>
<li>Give that we can only have one delegate set at a time in an object, what would the implementation look like for when the lecturer says <em>""Define a generic interface for observers (like delegation)""</em>.  A pseudocode example would be awfully helpful here if possible.</li>

"573294","<p>I am little confused with the applicability of <code>reinterpret_cast</code> vs <code>static_cast</code>. From what I have read the general rules are to use static cast when the types can be interpreted at compile time hence the word <code>static</code>. This is the cast the C++ compiler uses internally for implicit casts also.</p>

<p><code>reinterpret_cast</code>s are applicable in two scenarios:</p>

<ul>
<li>convert integer types to pointer types and vice versa </li>
<li>convert one pointer type to another. The general idea I get is this is unportable and should be avoided.  </li>
</ul>

<p>Where I am a little confused is one usage which I need, I am calling C++ from C and the C code needs to hold on to the C++ object so basically it holds a <code>void*</code>. What cast should be used to convert between the <code>void *</code> and the Class type?</p>

<p>I have seen usage of both <code>static_cast</code> and <code>reinterpret_cast</code>? Though from what I have been reading it appears <code>static</code> is better as the cast can happen at compile time?

"573872","<p>I like instantiating my WCF service clients within a <code>using</code> block as it's pretty much the standard way to use resources that implement <code>IDisposable</code>:</p>

<pre><code>using (var client = new SomeWCFServiceClient()) 
{
    //Do something with the client 
}
</code></pre>

<p>But, as noted in <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa355056.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">this MSDN article</a>, wrapping a WCF client in a <code>using</code> block could mask any errors that result in the client being left in a faulted state (like a timeout or communication problem). Long story short, when Dispose() is called, the client's Close() method fires, but throws an error because it's in a faulted state. The original exception is then masked by the second exception. Not good.</p>

<p>The suggested workaround in the MSDN article is to completely avoid using a <code>using</code> block, and to instead instantiate your clients and use them something like this:</p>

<pre><code>try
{
    ...
    client.Close();
}
catch (CommunicationException e)
{
    ...
    client.Abort();
}
catch (TimeoutException e)
{
    ...
    client.Abort();
}
catch (Exception e)
{
    ...
    client.Abort();
    throw;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Compared to the <code>using</code> block, I think that's ugly. And a lot of code to write each time you need a client.</p>

<p>Luckily, I found a few other workarounds, such as this one on IServiceOriented. You start with:</p>

<pre><code>public delegate void UseServiceDelegate&lt;T&gt;(T proxy); 

public static class Service&lt;T&gt; 
{ 
    public static ChannelFactory&lt;T&gt; _channelFactory = new ChannelFactory&lt;T&gt;(""""); 

    public static void Use(UseServiceDelegate&lt;T&gt; codeBlock) 
    { 
        IClientChannel proxy = (IClientChannel)_channelFactory.CreateChannel(); 
        bool success = false; 
        try 
        { 
            codeBlock((T)proxy); 
            proxy.Close(); 
            success = true; 
        } 
        finally 
        { 
            if (!success) 
            { 
                proxy.Abort(); 
            } 
        } 
     } 
} 
</code></pre>

<p>Which then allows:</p>

<pre><code>Service&lt;IOrderService&gt;.Use(orderService =&gt; 
{ 
    orderService.PlaceOrder(request); 
}); 
</code></pre>

<p>That's not bad, but I don't think it's as expressive and easily understandable as the <code>using</code> block.</p>

<p>The workaround I'm currently trying to use I first read about on <a href=""http://blog.davidbarrett.net/archive/2007/11.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">blog.davidbarret.net</a>. Basically you override the client's <code>Dispose()</code> method wherever you use it. Something like:</p>

<pre><code>public partial class SomeWCFServiceClient : IDisposable
{
    void IDisposable.Dispose() 
    {
        if (this.State == CommunicationState.Faulted) 
        {
            this.Abort();
        } 
        else 
        {
            this.Close();
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This appears to be able to allow the <code>using</code> block again without the danger of masking a faulted state exception. </p>

<p>So, are there any other gotchas I have to look out for using these workarounds? Has anybody come up with anything better?</p>

"577554","<p>One of the stated reasons for knowing assembler is that, on occasion, it can be employed to write code that will be more performant than writing that code in a higher-level language, C in particular.  However, I've also heard it stated many times that although that's not entirely false, the cases where assembler can <strong>actually</strong> be used to generate more performant code are both extremely rare and require expert knowledge of and experience with assembly.  </p>

<p>This question doesn't even get into the fact that assembler instructions will be machine-specific and non-portable, or any of the other aspects of assembler.  There are plenty of good reasons for knowing assembly besides this one, of course, but this is meant to be a specific question soliciting examples and data, not an extended discourse on assembler versus higher-level languages.</p>

<p>Can anyone provide some <strong>specific examples</strong> of cases where assembly will be faster than well-written C code using a modern compiler, and can you support that claim with profiling evidence?

"599308","<p>I've been programming for a while but It's been mostly Java and C#. I've never actually had to manage memory on my own. I recently began programming in C++ and I'm a little confused as to when I should store things on the stack and when to store them on the heap.</p>

<p>My understanding is that variables which are accessed very frequently should be stored on the stack and objects, rarely used variables, and large data structures should all be stored on the heap. Is this correct or am I incorrect?</p>

"599365","<p>For example, I recently came across this in the linux kernel:</p>

<pre>
/* Force a compilation error if condition is true */
#define BUILD_BUG_ON(condition) ((void)sizeof(char[1 - 2*!!(condition)]))
</pre>

<p>So, in your code, if you have some structure which must be, say a multiple of 8 bytes in size, maybe because of some hardware constraints, you can do:</p>

<pre>
BUILD_BUG_ON((sizeof(struct mystruct) % 8) != 0);
</pre>

<p>and it won't compile unless the size of struct mystruct is a multiple of 8, and if it is a multiple of 8, no runtime code is generated at all.</p>

<p>Another trick I know is from the book ""Graphics Gems"" which allows a single header file to both declare and initialize variables in one module while in other modules using that module, merely declare them as externs.</p>

<pre>
#ifdef DEFINE_MYHEADER_GLOBALS
#define GLOBAL
#define INIT(x, y) (x) = (y)
#else
#define GLOBAL extern
#define INIT(x, y)
#endif

GLOBAL int INIT(x, 0);
GLOBAL int somefunc(int a, int b);
</pre>

<p>With that, the code which defines x and somefunc does:</p>

<pre>
#define DEFINE_MYHEADER_GLOBALS
#include ""the_above_header_file.h""
</pre>

<p>while code that's merely using x and somefunc() does:</p>

<pre>
#include ""the_above_header_file.h""
</pre>

<p>So you get one header file that declares both instances of globals and function prototypes where they are needed, and the corresponding extern declarations.</p>

"600293","<p>Today I needed a simple algorithm for checking if a number is a power of 2.</p>

<p>The algorithm needs to be:</p>

<ol>
<li>Simple</li>
<li>Correct for any <code>ulong</code> value.</li>
</ol>

<p>I came up with this simple algorithm:</p>

<pre><code>private bool IsPowerOfTwo(ulong number)
{
    if (number == 0)
        return false;

    for (ulong power = 1; power &gt; 0; power = power &lt;&lt; 1)
    {
        // This for loop used shifting for powers of 2, meaning
        // that the value will become 0 after the last shift
        // (from binary 1000...0000 to 0000...0000) then, the 'for'
        // loop will break out.

        if (power == number)
            return true;
        if (power &gt; number)
            return false;
    }
    return false;
}
</code></pre>

<p>But then I thought, how about checking if <code>log<sub>2</sub> x</code> is an exactly round number? But when I checked for 2^63+1, <code>Math.Log</code> returned exactly 63 because of rounding. So I checked if 2 to the power 63 is equal to the original number - and it is, because the calculation is done in <code>double</code>s and not in exact numbers:</p>

<pre><code>private bool IsPowerOfTwo_2(ulong number)
{
    double log = Math.Log(number, 2);
    double pow = Math.Pow(2, Math.Round(log));
    return pow == number;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This returned <code>true</code> for the given wrong value: <code>9223372036854775809</code>.</p>

I also know that I should be able to add <code>template</code> somewhere to tell the compiler that inUnion is a template-id. But where exactly? And should it then assume that inUnion is a class template, i.e. <code>inUnion&lt;U&gt;</code> names a type and not a function?</p>

"611906","<p>I'm designing an API to go over HTTP and I am wondering if using the HTTP POST command, but with URL query parameters only and no request body, is a good way to go.</p>
<p>Considerations:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Good Web design&quot; requires non-idempotent actions to be sent via POST. This is a non-idempotent action.</li>
<li>It is easier to develop and debug this app when the request parameters are present in the URL.</li>
<li>The API is not intended for widespread use.</li>
<li>It seems like making a POST request with no body will take a bit more work, e.g. a <code>Content-Length: 0</code> header must be explicitly added.</li>
<li>It also seems to me that a POST with no body is a bit counter to most developer's and HTTP frameworks' expectations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Are there any more pitfalls or advantages to sending parameters on a POST request via the URL query rather than the request body?</p>
<p>Edit: The reason this is under consideration is that the operations are not idempotent and have side effects other than retrieval. See <a href=""http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">the HTTP spec</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In particular, the convention has been
established that the GET and HEAD
methods SHOULD NOT have the
significance of taking an action other
than retrieval. These methods ought to
be considered &quot;safe&quot;. This allows user
agents to represent other methods,
such as POST, PUT and DELETE, in a
special way, so that the user is made
aware of the fact that a possibly
unsafe action is being requested.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Methods can also have the property of
&quot;idempotence&quot; in that (aside from
error or expiration issues) the
side-effects of N &gt; 0 identical
requests is the same as for a single
request. The methods GET, HEAD, PUT
and DELETE share this property. Also,
the methods OPTIONS and TRACE SHOULD
NOT have side effects, and so are
inherently idempotent.</p>

"613954","<p>For a number of years now I have been unable to get a decent answer to the following question: why are some developers so against checked exceptions?  I have had numerous conversations, read things on blogs, read what Bruce Eckel had to say (the first person I saw speak out against them).</p>
<p>I am currently writing some new code and paying very careful attention to how I deal with exceptions.  I am trying to see the point of view of the &quot;we don't like checked exceptions&quot; crowd and I still cannot see it.</p>
<p>Every conversation I have ends with the same question going unanswered... let me set it up:</p>
<p>In general (from how Java was designed),</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Error</code> is for things that should never be caught (VM has a peanut allergy and someone dropped a jar of peanuts on it)</li>
<li><code>RuntimeException</code> is for things that the programmer did wrong (programmer walked off the end of an array)</li>
<li><code>Exception</code> (except <code>RuntimeException</code>) is for things that are out of the programmer's control (disk fills up while writing to the file system, file handle limit for the process has been reached and you cannot open any more files)</li>
<li><code>Throwable</code> is simply the parent of all of the exception types.</li>
</ul>
<p>A common argument I hear is that if an exception happens then all the developer is going to do is exit the program.</p>
<p>Another common argument I hear is that checked exceptions make it harder to refactor code.</p>
<p>For the &quot;all I am going to do is exit&quot; argument I say that even if you are exiting you need to display a reasonable error message.  If you are just punting on handling errors then your users won't be overly happy when the program exits without a clear indication of why.</p>
<p>For the &quot;it makes it hard to refactor&quot; crowd, that indicates that the proper level of abstraction wasn't chosen.  Rather than declare a method throws an <code>IOException</code>, the <code>IOException</code> should be transformed into an exception that is more suited for what is going on.</p>
<p>I don't have an issue with wrapping Main with <code>catch(Exception)</code> (or in some cases <code>catch(Throwable)</code> to ensure that the program can exit gracefully - but I always catch the specific exceptions I need to.  Doing that allows me to, at the very least, display an appropriate error message.</p>
<p>The question that people never reply to is this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you throw <code>RuntimeException</code>
subclasses instead of <code>Exception</code>
subclasses then how do you know what
you are supposed to catch?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the answer is catch <code>Exception</code> then you are also dealing with programmer errors the same way as system exceptions.  That seems wrong to me.</p>
<p>If you catch <code>Throwable</code> then you are treating system exceptions and VM errors (and the like) the same way.  That seems wrong to me.</p>
<p>If the answer is that you catch only the exceptions you know are thrown then how do you know what ones are thrown?  What happens when programmer X throws a new exception and forgot to catch it?  That seems very dangerous to me.</p>
<p>I would say that a program that displays a stack trace is wrong.  Do people who don't like checked exceptions not feel that way?</p>
<p>So, if you don't like checked exceptions can you explain why not AND answer the question that doesn't get answered please?</p>
<p>I am not looking for advice on when to use either model, what I am looking for is <em>why</em> people extend from <code>RuntimeException</code> because they don't like extending from <code>Exception</code> and/or why they catch an exception and then rethrow a <code>RuntimeException</code> rather than add throws to their method.  I want to understand the motivation for disliking checked exceptions.</p>

Trouble is, we don't have a whole lot of budget here, so I have to justify the expense to the powers that be.  So I want to know:</p>

<p>
<li> What kind of tools/licenses will I need?  Right now, we use Visual Studio and Smart Assembly to build, and Perforce for source control.  Will I need something else, or is there an equivalent of a cron job for running automated scripts?
<li> What, exactly, will this get me, other than an indication of a broken build?  Should I set up test projects in this solution (sln file) that will be run by these scripts, so I can have particular functions tested?  We have, at the moment, two such tests, because we haven't had the time (or frankly, the experience) to make good unit tests.
<li> What kind of hardware will I need for this?
<li> Once a build has been finished and tested, is it a common practice to put that build up on an ftp site or have some other way for internal access?  The idea is that this machine makes <em>the</em> build, and we all go to it, but can make debug builds if we have to.<br>
<li> How often should we make this kind of build?
<li> How is space managed?  If we make nightly builds, should we keep around all the old builds, or start to ditch them after about a week or so?
<li> Is there anything else I'm not seeing here?

"635483","<p>I have a data structure which essentially amounts to a nested dictionary. Let's say it looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>{'new jersey': {'mercer county': {'plumbers': 3,
                                  'programmers': 81},
                'middlesex county': {'programmers': 81,
                                     'salesmen': 62}},
 'new york': {'queens county': {'plumbers': 9,
                                'salesmen': 36}}}
</code></pre>

<p>Now, maintaining and creating this is pretty painful; every time I have a new state/county/profession I have to create the lower layer dictionaries via obnoxious try/catch blocks. Moreover, I have to create annoying nested iterators if I want to go over all the values. </p>

<p>I could also use tuples as keys, like such:</p>

<pre><code>{('new jersey', 'mercer county', 'plumbers'): 3,
 ('new jersey', 'mercer county', 'programmers'): 81,
 ('new jersey', 'middlesex county', 'programmers'): 81,
 ('new jersey', 'middlesex county', 'salesmen'): 62,
 ('new york', 'queens county', 'plumbers'): 9,
 ('new york', 'queens county', 'salesmen'): 36}
</code></pre>

<p>This makes iterating over the values very simple and natural, but it is more syntactically painful to do things like aggregations and looking at subsets of the dictionary (e.g. if I just want to go state-by-state).</p>

<p>Basically, sometimes I want to think of a nested dictionary as a flat dictionary, and sometimes I want to think of it indeed as a complex hierarchy. I could wrap this all in a class, but it seems like someone might have done this already. Alternatively, it seems like there might be some really elegant syntactical constructions to do this. </p>

<p>What's the real result here?  My thinking is that the process dies and then the heap space is gone anyway so there's no harm in missing the call to <code>free</code> (however, I do recognize the importance of having it anyway for closure, maintainability, and good practice).  Am I right in this thinking?</p>

<p>Second, let's say I have a program that acts a bit like a shell.  Users can declare variables like <code>aaa = 123</code> and those are stored in some dynamic data structure for later use.  Clearly, it seems obvious that you'd use some solution that will calls some *alloc function (hashmap, linked list, something like that).  For this kind of program, it doesn't make sense to ever free after calling <code>malloc</code> because these variables must be present at all times during the program's execution and there's no good way (that I can see) to implement this with statically allocated space.  Is it bad design to have a bunch of memory that's allocated but only freed as part of the process ending?  If so, what's the alternative?</p>

"655065","<p>I've been using C++ for a short while, and I've been wondering about the <em>new</em> keyword. Simply, should I be using it, or not?</p>

<p>1) With the <em>new</em> keyword...</p>

<pre><code>MyClass* myClass = new MyClass();
myClass-&gt;MyField = ""Hello world!"";
</code></pre>

<p>2) Without the <em>new</em> keyword...</p>

<pre><code>MyClass myClass;
myClass.MyField = ""Hello world!"";
</code></pre>

<p>From an implementation perspective, they don't seem that different (but I'm sure they are)... However, my primary language is C#, and of course the 1st method is what I'm used to.</p>

<p>The difficulty seems to be that method 1 is harder to use with the std C++ classes.</p>

<p>Which method should I use?</p>

<h3>Update 1:</h3>

<p>I recently used the <em>new</em> keyword for <em>heap</em> memory (or <em>free store</em>) for a large array which was going out of scope (i.e. being returned from a function). Where before I was using the stack, which caused half of the elements to be corrupt outside of scope, switching to heap usage ensured that the elements were in tact. Yay!</p>

<h3>Update 2:</h3>

<p>A friend of mine recently told me there's a simple rule for using the <code>new</code> keyword; every time you type <code>new</code>, type <code>delete</code>.</p>

<pre><code>Foobar *foobar = new Foobar();
delete foobar; // TODO: Move this to the right place.
</code></pre>

<p>This helps to prevent memory leaks, as you always have to put the delete somewhere (i.e. when you cut and paste it to either a destructor or otherwise).</p>

<p>I understand the distinction between <strong><code>+T</code></strong> and <strong><code>T</code></strong> in the type declaration (it compiles if I use <strong><code>T</code></strong>).

"664205","<p>From <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/526641/what-to-put-in-your-viewmodel"">this question</a>, it looks like it makes sense to have a controller create a <strong>ViewModel</strong> that more accurately reflects the model that the view is trying to display, but I'm curious about some of the conventions (I'm new to the MVC pattern, if it wasn't already obvious).</p>

<p>Basically, I had the following questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>I normally like to have one class/file.  Does this make sense with a <strong>ViewModel</strong> if it is only being created to hand off data from a controller to a view?</li>
<li>If a <strong>ViewModel</strong> does belong in its own file, and you're using a directory/project structure to keep things separate, where does the <strong>ViewModel</strong> file belong?  In the <strong>Controllers</strong> directory?</li>
</ol>

<p>That's basically it for now.  I might have a few more questions coming up, but this has been bothering me for the last hour or so, and I can seem to find consistent guidance elsewhere.</p>

<p>On a website, it's common practice to create a logo that links to the homepage. I want to do the same, while best optimizing for search engines, screen readers, IE 6+, and browsers who have disabled CSS and/or images.</p>

<p><strong>Example One:</strong> Doesn't use an h1 tag. Not as good for SEO, right?</p>

        &lt;img src=""logo.png"" alt=""Stack Overflow"" /&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<p><strong>Example Two:</strong> Found this somewhere. The CSS seems a little hacky.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;h1 id=""logo""&gt;
    &lt;a href=""""&gt;Stack Overflow&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
</code></pre>

<pre class=""lang-css prettyprint-override""><code>/* css */
#logo {
    padding: 70px 0 0 0;
    overflow: hidden;
    background-image: url(""logo.png"");
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    height: 0px !important;
    height /**/:70px;
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Example Three:</strong> Same HTML, different approach using text-indent. This is the ""Phark"" approach to image replacement.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;h1 id=""logo""&gt;
    &lt;a href=""""&gt;Stack Overflow&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;

<p>proposes a 1-line method to timeout a long-running command from the bash command line:</p>
<pre><code>( /path/to/slow command with options ) &amp; sleep 5 ; kill $!
</code></pre>
<p>But it's possible that a given &quot;long-running&quot; command may finish earlier than the timeout.<br />
(Let's call it a &quot;typically-long-running-but-sometimes-fast&quot; command, or <em>tlrbsf</em> for fun.)</p>
<p>So this nifty 1-liner approach has a couple of problems.<br />
First, the <code>sleep</code> isn't conditional, so that sets an undesirable lower bound on the time taken for the sequence to finish. Consider 30s or 2m or even 5m for the sleep, when the <em>tlrbsf</em> command finishes in 2 seconds — highly undesirable.<br />
Second, the <code>kill</code> is unconditional, so this sequence will attempt to kill a non-running process and whine about it.</p>
<p>So...</p>
<p><strong>Is there a way</strong> to timeout a typically-long-running-but-sometimes-fast (<em>&quot;tlrbsf&quot;</em>) command that</p>
<ul>
<li>has a bash implementation (the other question already has Perl and C answers)</li>
<li>will terminate at the earlier of the two: <em>tlrbsf</em> program termination, or timeout elapsed</li>
<li>will not kill non-existing/non-running processes (or, optionally: will not <em>complain</em> about a bad kill)</li>
<li>doesn't have to be a 1-liner</li>
<li>can run under Cygwin or Linux</li>
</ul>
<p>... and, for bonus points</p>
<ul>
<li>runs the <em>tlrbsf</em> command in the foreground</li>
<li>any 'sleep' or extra process in the background</li>
</ul>
<p>such that the stdin/stdout/stderr of the <em>tlrbsf</em> command can be redirected, same as if it had been run directly?</p>
<p>If so, please share your code. If not, please explain why.</p>

<p>People often want to match starting tags to ending tags, but XML and HTML allow tags to contain themselves (which traditional regexes cannot handle at all):</p>

<pre><code>&lt;span id=""outer""&gt;&lt;span id=""inner""&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p>People often want to match against the content of a document (such as the famous ""find all phone numbers on a given page"" problem), but the data may be marked up (even if it appears to be normal when viewed):</p>

"742013","<p>I want to create a URL shortener service where you can write a long URL into an input field and the service shortens the URL to ""<code>http://www.example.org/abcdef</code>"".</p>

<p>Instead of ""<code>abcdef</code>"" there can be any other string with six characters containing <code>a-z, A-Z and 0-9</code>. That makes 56~57 billion possible strings.</p>

<p>My approach:</p>

<p>I have a database table with three columns:</p>

<ol>
<li>id, integer, auto-increment</li>
<li>long, string, the long URL the user entered</li>
<li>short, string, the shortened URL (or just the six characters)</li>
</ol>

<p>I would then insert the long URL into the table. Then I would select the auto-increment value for ""<code>id</code>"" and build a hash of it. This hash should then be inserted as ""<code>short</code>"". But what sort of hash should I build? Hash algorithms like MD5 create too long strings. I don't use these algorithms, I think. A self-built algorithm will work, too.</p>

<p>My idea:</p>

<p>For ""<code>http://www.google.de/</code>"" I get the auto-increment id <code>239472</code>. Then I do the following steps:</p>

<pre><code>short = '';
if divisible by 2, add ""a""+the result to short
if divisible by 3, add ""b""+the result to short
... until I have divisors for a-z and A-Z.
</code></pre>

<p>That could be repeated until the number isn't divisible any more. Do you think this is a good approach? Do you have a better idea?</p>

"746047","<p>I hope that in this post, I can get people's opinions on best practices for the interface between JSF pages and backing beans.</p>

<p>One thing that I never can settle on is the structure of my backing beans. Furthermore, I have never found a good article on the subject.</p>

<p>What properties belong on which backing beans? When is it appropriate to add more properties to a given bean as opposed to creating a new bean and adding the properties onto it? For simple applications, does it make sense to just have a single backing bean for the whole page, considering the complexity involved with injecting one bean into another? Should the backing bean contain any actual business logic, or should it strictly contain data? </p>

<p>Feel free to answer these questions and any others that may come up.</p>

<hr />

<p>As for reducing coupling between the JSF page and the backing bean, I never allow the JSF page to access any backing bean property's properties. For example, I never allow something such as:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;h:outputText value=""#{myBean.anObject.anObjectProperty}"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I always require something like:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;h:outputText value=""#{myBean.theObjectProperty}"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>with a backing bean value of:</p>

<pre><code>public String getTheObjectProperty()
{
    return anObject.getAnObjectProperty();
}
</code></pre>

<p>When I loop over a collection, I use a wrapper class to avoid drilling down into an object in a data table, for instance. </p>

<p>In general, this approach feels ""right"" to me. It avoids any coupling between the view and the data. Please correct me if I'm wrong.</p>

"746082","<p>Lately I have been playing a game on my iPhone called Scramble. Some of you may know this game as Boggle. Essentially, when the game starts you get a matrix of letters like so:</p>

<pre><code>F X I E
A M L O
E W B X
A S T U
</code></pre>

<p>The goal of the game is to find as many words as you can that can be formed by chaining letters together. You can start with any letter, and all the letters that surround it are fair game, and then once you move on to the next letter, all the letters that surround that letter are fair game, <strong>except for any previously used letters</strong>. So in the grid above, for example, I could come up with the words <code>LOB</code>, <code>TUX</code>, <code>SEA</code>, <code>FAME</code>, etc. Words must be at least 3 characters, and no more than NxN characters, which would be 16 in this game but can vary in some implementations.  While this game is fun and addictive, I am apparently not very good at it and I wanted to cheat a little bit by making a program that would give me the best possible words (the longer the word the more points you get).</p>

<p>How do you create a shallow copy with git-svn from a Subversion repository, e.g. how do you pull only the last three revisions?</p>

<p>The <code>git clone</code> command can get the last n revisions from a Git repository if you use the option <code>--depth</code>, i.e. you get a shallow copy of the repository. Example:</p>

<p>Is there a similar option for git-svn?</p>

<p>So far I've only found the <code>-rN</code> option where <code>N</code> is the revision to pull. Example:</p>

<pre><code>git svn clone -rN svn://some/repo
</code></pre>

<p>According to the documentation there is the possibility to use <code>-r$REVNUMBER:HEAD</code>. I tried the following to get the last 3 revisions which returned an error message.</p>

<pre><code>$ git svn clone --prefix=svn/ -s -rHEAD~3:HEAD http://some/svn/repo .
revision argument: HEAD~3:HEAD not understood by git-svn
</code></pre>

<p>So I replaced <code>HEAD~3</code> with the actual number of the third but last revision 534. That worked, but that requires me to first figure out the revision number of the third but last commit.</p>

<p>According to a comment toward <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/752479/am-i-initializing-my-c-reference-variables-correctly"">this question I just asked, regarding initializing references</a>, returning a reference can be evil because, [as I understand] it makes it easier to miss deleting it, which can lead to memory leaks.</p>

<p>This worries me, as I have followed examples (unless I'm imagining things) and done this in a fair few places... Have I misunderstood? Is it evil? If so, just how evil?</p>

I have explained every aspect of them I could think of, but it seems they are waiting for me to mention something specific, and I don't know what it is.</p>

<p>From my experience I think the following is true. If I am missing a major point please let me know.</p>

<p><strong>Interface:</strong></p>

<p>Every single Method declared in an Interface will have to be implemented in the subclass.
Only Events, Delegates, Properties (C#) and Methods can exist in a Interface. A class can implement multiple Interfaces.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract Class:</strong></p>

<p>Only Abstract methods have to be implemented by the subclass. An Abstract class can have normal methods with implementations. Abstract class can also have class variables beside Events, Delegates, Properties and Methods. A class can only implement one abstract class only due non-existence of Multi-inheritance in C#.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>After all that, the interviewer came up with the question ""What if you had an Abstract class with only abstract methods? How would that be different from an interface?"" I didn't know the answer but I think it's the inheritance as mentioned above right?</p></li>
<li><p>An another interviewer asked me what if you had a Public variable inside the interface, how would that be different than in Abstract Class? I insisted you can't have a public variable inside an interface. I didn't know what he wanted to hear but he wasn't satisfied either.</p></li>

<p>I am not sure how to implement pagination on a resource in a RESTful web application.
Assuming that I have a resource called <code>products</code>, which of the following do you think is the best approach, and why:</p>

<h2>1. Using only query strings</h2>

<p>eg. <code>http://application/products?page=2&amp;sort_by=date&amp;sort_how=asc</code>
<br />The problem here is that I can't use full page caching and also the URL is not very clean and easy to remember.</p>

<h2>2. Using pages as resources and query strings for sorting</h2>

<p>eg. <code>http://application/products/page/2?sort_by=date&amp;sort_how=asc</code>
<br />In this case, the problem that is see is that <code>http://application/products/pages/1</code> is not a unique resource since using <code>sort_by=price</code> can yield a totally different result <em>and</em> I still can't use page caching.</p>

<h2>3. Using pages as resources and an URL segment for sorting</h2>

<p>eg. <code>http://application/products/by-date/page/2</code>
<br />I personally see no problem in using this method, but someone warned me that this is not a good way to go (he didn't give a reason, so if you know <em>why</em> it's not recommended, please let me know)</p>

This dynamically loaded <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> had a pre-selected value.  In IE6, we already had code to fix the selected <code>&lt;option&gt;</code>, because sometimes the <code>&lt;select&gt;</code>'s <code>selectedIndex</code> value would be out of sync with the selected <code>&lt;option&gt;</code>'s <code>index</code> attribute, as below:</p>

<pre><code>field.selectedIndex = element.index;
</code></pre>

<p>However, this code wasn't working.  Even though the field's <code>selectedIndex</code> was being set correctly, the wrong index would end up being selected.  However, if I stuck an <code>alert()</code> statement in at the right time, the correct option would be selected.  Thinking this might be some sort of timing issue, I tried something random that I'd seen in code before:</p>

<pre><code>var wrapFn = (function() {
    var myField = field;
    var myElement = element;

    return function() {
        myField.selectedIndex = myElement.index;

})();
setTimeout(wrapFn, 0);

<p>As of C# 6, <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/45949862/3195477"">the answer</a> to this question is:</p>

<pre><code>SomeEvent?.Invoke(this, e);
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>I frequently hear/read the following advice:</p>

<p>Always make a copy of an event before you check it for <code>null</code> and fire it. This will eliminate a potential problem with threading where the event becomes <code>null</code> at the location right between where you check for null and where you fire the event:</p>

<pre><code>// Copy the event delegate before checking/calling
EventHandler copy = TheEvent;

if (copy != null)
    copy(this, EventArgs.Empty); // Call any handlers on the copied list
</code></pre>

<p><em>Updated</em>: I thought from reading about optimizations that this might also require the event member to be volatile, but Jon Skeet states in his answer that the CLR doesn't optimize away the copy.</p>

<p>But meanwhile, in order for this issue to even occur, another thread must have done something like this:</p>

<pre><code>// Better delist from event - don't want our handler called from now on:
otherObject.TheEvent -= OnTheEvent;
// Good, now we can be certain that OnTheEvent will not run...
</code></pre>

<p>The actual sequence might be this mixture:</p>

<pre><code>// Copy the event delegate before checking/calling
EventHandler copy = TheEvent;

// Better delist from event - don't want our handler called from now on:
otherObject.TheEvent -= OnTheEvent;    
// Good, now we can be certain that OnTheEvent will not run...

if (copy != null)
    copy(this, EventArgs.Empty); // Call any handlers on the copied list
</code></pre>

<p>The point being that <code>OnTheEvent</code> runs after the author has unsubscribed, and yet they just unsubscribed specifically to avoid that happening. Surely what is really needed is a custom event implementation with appropriate synchronisation in the <code>add</code> and <code>remove</code> accessors. And in addition there is the problem of possible deadlocks if a lock is held while an event is fired.</p>

<p>So is this <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult_programming"" rel=""noreferrer"">Cargo Cult Programming</a>? It seems that way - a lot of people must be taking this step to protect their code from multiple threads, when in reality it seems to me that events require much more care than this before they can be used as part of a multi-threaded design. Consequently, people who are not taking that additional care might as well ignore this advice - it simply isn't an issue for single-threaded programs, and in fact, given the absence of <code>volatile</code> in most online example code, the advice may be having no effect at all.</p>

<p>(And isn't it a lot simpler to just assign the empty <code>delegate { }</code> on the member declaration so that you never need to check for <code>null</code> in the first place?)</p>

<p><em>Updated:</em> In case it wasn't clear, I did grasp the intention of the advice - to avoid a null reference exception under all circumstances. My point is that this particular null reference exception can only occur if another thread is delisting from the event, and the only reason for doing that is to ensure that no further calls will be received via that event, which clearly is NOT achieved by this technique. You'd be concealing a race condition - it would be better to reveal it! That null exception helps to detect an abuse of your component. If you want your component to be protected from abuse, you could follow the example of WPF - store the thread ID in your constructor and then throw an exception if another thread tries to interact directly with your component. Or else implement a truly thread-safe component (not an easy task).</p>

<p>So I contend that merely doing this copy/check idiom is cargo cult programming, adding mess and noise to your code. To actually protect against other threads requires a lot more work.</p>

<p><strong>Update in response to Eric Lippert's blog posts:</strong></p>

<p>So there's a major thing I'd missed about event handlers: ""event handlers are required to be robust in the face of being called even after the event has been unsubscribed"", and obviously therefore we only need to care about the possibility of the event delegate being <code>null</code>. <em>Is that requirement on event handlers documented anywhere?</em></p>

<p>And so: ""There are other ways to solve this problem; for example, initializing the handler to have an empty action that is never removed. But doing a null check is the standard pattern.""</p>

<p>So the one remaining fragment of my question is, <em>why is explicit-null-check the ""standard pattern""?</em> The alternative, assigning the empty delegate, requires only <code>= delegate {}</code> to be added to the event declaration, and this eliminates those little piles of stinky ceremony from every place where the event is raised. It would be easy to make sure that the empty delegate is cheap to instantiate. Or am I still missing something?</p>

<p>Surely it must be that (as Jon Skeet suggested) this is just .NET 1.x advice that hasn't died out, as it should have done in 2005?</p>

<p><strong>My goal is to inspire students that programming is cool</strong>. </p>

<p>We <em>know</em> that programming is cool because you can create anything you imagine - it's the ultimate creative outlet.  I want to inspire these beginners and get them over as many early-learning humps as I can.</p>

<p>Now, my reasons are selfish.  I'm teaching an <em>Intro to Computing</em> course to a group of 60 half-engineering, half business majors; all freshmen.  They are the students who came from underprivileged High schools.  From my past experience, the group is generally split as follows: a few <a href=""http://www.google.com/#hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=Rockstar+Programmers&amp;fp=WnpED7D_IvM"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">rock-stars</a>, some who try very hard and <em>kind of</em> get it, the few who try very hard and <em>barely</em> get it, and the few who don't care.  I want to reach as many of these groups as effectively as I can. Here's an example of how I'd use a computer program to teach:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Here's an example of what I'm looking
  for:  a 1-line VBS script to get your
  computer to talk to you:</p>

<pre><code>CreateObject(""sapi.spvoice"").Speak InputBox(""Enter your text"",""Talk it"")
</code></pre>
  
  <p>I could use this to demonstrate order
  of operations.  I'd show the code, let
  them play with it, then explain that
  There's a lot going on in that line,
  but the computer can make sense of it,
  because it knows the rules.  Then I'd
  show them something like this:</p>

<pre><code>4(5*5) / 10 + 9(.25 + .75)
</code></pre>
  
  <p>And you can see that first I need to
  do is (5*5).  Then I can multiply for
  4.  And now I've created the Object.  Dividing by 10 is the same as calling
  Speak - I can't Speak before I have an
  object, and I can't divide before I
  have 100.  Then on the other side I
  first create an InputBox with some
  instructions for how to display it. 
  When I hit enter on the input box it
  evaluates or ""returns"" whatever I
  entered.  (Hint: 'oooooo' makes a
  funny sound)  So when I say Speak, the
  right side is what to Speak.  And I
  get that from the InputBox.</p>
  
  <p>So when you do several things on a
  line, like:</p>

<pre><code>x = 14 + y;
</code></pre>
  
  <p>You need to be aware of the order of
  things.  First we add 14 and y.  Then
  we put the result (what it evaluates
  to, or returns) into x.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That's my goal, to have a bunch of these cool examples to demonstrate and teach the class while they have fun.  I tried this example on my roommate and while I may not use this as the first lesson, she liked it and learned something.</p>

<p>Some cool <a href=""http://reference.wolfram.com/legacy/v5/Tour/WritingProgramsInMathematica.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">mathematica programs that make beautiful graphs or shapes</a> that are easy to understand would be good ideas and I'm going to look into those.

<p>In part, Fowler states, ""<em>With service locator the application class asks for it [the service] explicitly by a message to the locator. With injection there is no explicit request, the service appears in the application class - hence the inversion of control.
Inversion of control is a common feature of frameworks, but it's something that comes at a price. It tends to be hard to understand and leads to problems when you are trying to debug. So on the whole I prefer to avoid it [Inversion of Control] unless I need it. This isn't to say it's a bad thing, just that I think it needs to justify itself over the more straightforward alternative.</em>""</p>

"859111","<p>A module I'm adding to our large Java application has to converse with another company's SSL-secured website.  The problem is that the site uses a self-signed certificate.  I have a copy of the certificate to verify that I'm not encountering a man-in-the-middle attack, and I need to incorporate this certificate into our code in such a way that the connection to the server will be successful.</p>

<p>Here's the basic code:</p>

<pre><code>void sendRequest(String dataPacket) {
  String urlStr = ""https://host.example.com/"";
  URL url = new URL(urlStr);
  HttpURLConnection conn = (HttpURLConnection)url.openConnection();
  conn.setMethod(""POST"");
  conn.setRequestProperty(""Content-Length"", data.length());
  conn.setDoOutput(true);
  OutputStreamWriter o = new OutputStreamWriter(conn.getOutputStream());
  o.write(data);
  o.flush();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Without any additional handling in place for the self-signed certificate, this dies at conn.getOutputStream() with the following exception:</p>

<pre><code>Exception in thread ""main"" javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: sun.security.validator.ValidatorException: PKIX path building failed: sun.security.provider.certpath.SunCertPathBuilderException: unable to find valid certification path to requested target

....
Caused by: sun.security.provider.certpath.SunCertPathBuilderException: unable to find valid certification path to requested target
</code></pre>

<p>Ideally, my code needs to teach Java to accept this one self-signed certificate, for this one spot in the application, and nowhere else.</p>

<p>I know that I can import the certificate into the JRE's certificate authority store, and that will allow Java to accept it.  That's not an approach I want to take if I can help; it seems very invasive to do on all of our customer's machines for one module they may not use; it would affect all other Java applications using the same JRE, and I don't like that even though the odds of any other Java application ever accessing this site are nil.  It's also not a trivial operation: on UNIX I have to obtain access rights to modify the JRE in this way.</p>

<p>I've also seen that I can create a TrustManager instance that does some custom checking.  It looks like I might even be able to create a TrustManager that delegates to the real TrustManager in all instances except this one certificate.  But it looks like that TrustManager gets installed globally, and I presume would affect all other connections from our application, and that doesn't smell quite right to me, either.</p>

<p>What is the preferred, standard, or best way to set up a Java application to accept a self-signed certificate?  Can I accomplish all of the goals I have in mind above, or am I going to have to compromise?  Is there an option involving files and directories and configuration settings, and little-to-no code?</p>

<p>Question: <strong>What database model, technique, or pattern should be used to deal with ""classes"" of attributes describing e-commerce products which can be changed at run time?</strong>  </p>

<p>In a good E-commerce database, you will store classes of options (like TV resolution then have a resolution for each TV, but the next product may not be a TV and not have ""TV resolution"").  How do you store them, search efficiently, and allow your users to setup product types with variable fields describing their products?  If the search engine finds that customers typically search for TVs based on console depth, you could add console depth to your fields, then add a single depth for each tv product type at run time.</p>

<p>There is a nice common feature among good e-commerce apps where they show a set of products, then have ""drill down"" side menus where you can see ""TV Resolution"" as a header, and the top five most common TV Resolutions for the found set.  You click one and it only shows TVs of that resolution, allowing you to further drill down by selecting other categories on the side menu.  These options would be the dynamic product attributes added at run time.</p>

<p><strong>Further discussion:</strong></p>

<p>So long story short, <strong>are there any links out on the Internet or model descriptions that could ""academically"" fix the following setup?</strong>  I thank Noel Kennedy for suggesting a category table, but the need may be greater than that.  I describe it a different way below, trying to highlight the significance.  I may need a viewpoint correction to solve the problem, or I may need to go deeper in to the EAV/CR.</p>

<p>Love the positive response to the EAV/CR model.  My fellow developers all say what Jeffrey Kemp touched on below: ""new entities must be modeled and designed by a professional"" (taken out of context, read his response below).  The problem is:</p>

<ul>
<li>entities add and remove attributes weekly <br /> <em>(search keywords dictate future attributes)</em></li>
<li>new entities arrive weekly <br /> <em>(products are assembled from parts)</em></li>
<li>old entities go away weekly <br /> <em>(archived, less popular, seasonal)</em></li>
</ul>

<p>The customer wants to add attributes to the products for two reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>department / keyword search / comparison chart between like products</li>
<li>consumer product configuration before checkout</li>
</ul>

<p>The attributes must have significance, not just a keyword search.  If they want to compare all cakes that have a ""whipped cream frosting"", they can click cakes, click birthday theme, click whipped cream frosting, then check all cakes that are interesting knowing they all have whipped cream frosting.  This is not specific to cakes, just an example.</p>

<p>I played with .NET containers like <a href=""http://docs.structuremap.net"" rel=""noreferrer"">StructureMap</a>, <a href=""http://www.ninject.org"" rel=""noreferrer"">NInject</a>, <a href=""http://unity.codeplex.com"" rel=""noreferrer"">Unity</a>, and <a href=""http://funq.codeplex.com"" rel=""noreferrer"">Funq</a>.  I still fail to see how an IoC container is going to benefit / improve my code.</p>

<p>I'm also afraid to start using a container at work because many of my co-workers will see code which they don't understand. Many of them may be reluctant to learn new technology.</p>

<p>Please, convince me that I need to use an IoC container.  I'm going to use these arguments when I talk to my fellow developers at work.</p>

"875467","<p>I am using Java 6 and am trying to create an <code>HttpsURLConnection</code> against a remote server, using a client certificate.<br>
The server is using an selfsigned root certificate, and requires that a password-protected client certificate is presented. I've added the server root certificate and the client certificate to a default java keystore which I found in <code>/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/1.6.0/Home/lib/security/cacerts</code> (OSX 10.5).
The name of the keystore file seems to suggest that the client certificate is not supposed to go in there?</p>

<p>Anyway, adding the root certificate to this store solved the infamous <code>javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: sun.security.validator.ValidatorException: PKIX path building failed' problem.</code></p>

<p>However, I'm now stuck on how to use the client certificate. I've tried two approaches and neither gets me anywhere.<br>
First, and preferred, try:</p>

<pre><code>SSLSocketFactory sslsocketfactory = (SSLSocketFactory) SSLSocketFactory.getDefault();
URL url = new URL(""https://somehost.dk:3049"");
HttpsURLConnection conn = (HttpsURLConnection)url.openConnection();
conn.setSSLSocketFactory(sslsocketfactory);
InputStream inputstream = conn.getInputStream();
// The last line fails, and gives:
// javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: Received fatal alert: handshake_failure
</code></pre>

<p>I've tried skipping the HttpsURLConnection class (not ideal since I want to talk HTTP with the server), and do this instead:</p>

<pre><code>SSLSocketFactory sslsocketfactory = (SSLSocketFactory) SSLSocketFactory.getDefault();
SSLSocket sslsocket = (SSLSocket) sslsocketfactory.createSocket(""somehost.dk"", 3049);
InputStream inputstream = sslsocket.getInputStream();
// do anything with the inputstream results in:
// java.net.SocketTimeoutException: Read timed out

}
</code></pre>

<p>The rest of the article looks sane and reasonable (to a noob), but that try-catch-throw throws a WtfException... <strong>Isn't this exactly equivalent to not handling exceptions at all?</strong></p>

You can use Unicode characters, so you get more than 8 bits per character. Even allowing for Unicode characters, however, you will need to compress images into a very small amount of space; this will certainly be a lossy compression, and so there will have to be subjective judgements about how good each result looks.</p>

<p>Can you do better?</p>

<h3>Rules</h3>

<ol>
<li>Your program must have two modes: <strong>encoding</strong> and <strong>decoding</strong>.</li>
<li>When <strong>encoding</strong>:

<ol>
<li>Your program must take as input a graphic in any reasonable <strong>raster</strong> graphic format of your choice. We'll say that any raster format supported by <a href=""http://www.imagemagick.org/script/formats.php"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ImageMagick</a> counts as reasonable.</li>
<li>Your program must output a message which can be represented in 140 or fewer Unicode code points; 140 code points in the range <code>U+0000</code>–<code>U+10FFFF</code>, excluding non-characters (<code>U+FFFE</code>, <code>U+FFFF</code>, <code>U+</code><em>n</em><code>FFFE</code>, <code>U+</code><em>n</em><code>FFFF</code> where <em>n</em> is <code>1</code>–<code>10</code> hexadecimal, and the range <code>U+FDD0</code>–<code>U+FDEF</code>) and surrogate code points (<code>U+D800</code>–<code>U+DFFF</code>). It may be output in any reasonable encoding of your choice; any encoding supported by <a href=""http://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">GNU <code>iconv</code></a> will be considered reasonable, and your platform native encoding or locale encoding would likely be a good choice. See <strong>Unicode notes</strong> below for more details.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>When <strong>decoding</strong>:

<ol>
<li>Your program should take as input the output of your <strong>encoding</strong> mode.</li>
<li>Your program must output an image in any reasonable format of your choice, as defined above, though for output vector formats are OK as well.</li>
<li>The image output should be an approximation of the input image; the closer you can get to the input image, the better.</li>
<li>The decoding process may have no access to any other output of the encoding process other than the output specified above; that is, you can't upload the image somewhere and output the URL for the decoding process to download, or anything silly like that.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>For the sake of consistency in user interface, your program must behave as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>Your program must be a script that can be set to executable on a platform with the appropriate interpreter, or a program that can be compiled into an executable.</li>
<li>Your program must take as its first argument either <code>encode</code> or <code>decode</code> to set the mode.</li>
<li><p>Your program must take input in one or more of the following ways (if you implement the one that takes file names, you may also read and write from stdin and stdout if file names are missing):</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Take input from standard in and produce output on standard out.</p>

<pre><code>my-program encode &lt;input.png &gt;output.txt
my-program decode &lt;output.txt &gt;output.png
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Take input from a file named in the second argument, and produce output in the file named in the third.</p>

<pre><code>my-program encode input.png output.txt
my-program decode output.txt output.png
</code></pre></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li>For your solution, please post:

<ol>
<li>Your code, in full, and/or a link to it hosted elsewhere (if it's very long, or requires many files to compile, or something).</li>
<li>An explanation of how it works, if it's not immediately obvious from the code or if the code is long and people will be interested in a summary.</li>
<li>An example image, with the original image, the text it compresses down to, and the decoded image.</li>
<li>If you are building on an idea that someone else had, please attribute them. It's OK to try to do a refinement of someone else's idea, but you <strong>must</strong> attribute them.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>

<h3>Guidelines</h3>

<p>These are basically rules that may be broken, suggestions, or scoring criteria:</p>

<ol>
<li>Aesthetics are important. I'll be judging, and suggest that other people judge, based on:

<ol>
<li>How good the output image looks, and how much it looks like the original.</li>
<li>How nice the text looks. Completely random gobbledigook is OK if you have a really clever compression scheme, but I also want to see answers that turn images into mutli-lingual poems, or something clever like that. Note that the author of the original solution decided to use only Chinese characters, since it looked nicer that way.</li>
<li>Interesting code and clever algorithms are always good. I like short, to the point, and clear code, but really clever complicated algorithms are OK too as long as they produce good results.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Speed is also important, though not as important as how good a job compressing the image you do. I'd rather have a program that can convert an image in a tenth of a second than something that will be running genetic algorithms for days on end.</li>
<li>I will prefer shorter solutions to longer ones, as long as they are reasonably comparable in quality; conciseness is a virtue.</li>
<li>Your program should be implemented in a language that has a freely-available implementation on Mac OS X, Linux, or Windows. I'd like to be able to run the programs, but if you have a great solution that only runs under <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MATLAB"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">MATLAB</a> or something, that's fine.</li>
<li>Your program should be as general as possible; it should work for as many different images as possible, though some may produce better results than others. In particular:

<ol>
<li>Having a few images built into the program that it matches and writes a reference to, and then produces the matching image upon decoding, is fairly lame and will only cover a few images.</li>
<li>A program that can take images of simple, flat, geometric shapes and decompose them into some vector primitive is pretty nifty, but if it fails on images beyond a certain complexity it is probably insufficiently general.</li>
<li>A program that can only take images of a particular fixed aspect ratio but does a good job with them would also be OK, but not ideal.</li>
<li>You may find that a black and white image can get more information into a smaller space than a color image. On the other hand, that may limit the types of image it's applicable to; faces come out fine in black and white, but abstract designs may not fare so well.</li>
<li>It is perfectly fine if the output image is smaller than the input, while being roughly the same proportion. It's OK if you have to scale the image up to compare it to the original; what's important is how it looks.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Your program should produce output that could actually go through Twitter and come out unscathed. This is only a guideline rather than a rule, since I couldn't find any documentation on the precise set of characters supported, but you should probably avoid control characters, funky invisible combining characters, private use characters, and the like.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Scoring rubric</h3>

<p>As a general guide to how I will be ranking solutions when choosing my accepted solution, lets say that I'll probably be evaluating solutions on a 25 point scale (this is very rough, and I won't be scoring anything directly, just using this as a basic guideline):</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>15 points</strong> for how well the encoding scheme reproduces a wide range of input images. This is a subjective, aesthetic judgement

<ul>
<li>0 means that it doesn't work at all, it gives the same image back every time, or something</li>
<li>5 means that it can encode a few images, though the decoded version looks ugly and it may not work at all on more complicated images</li>
<li>10 means that it works on a wide range of images, and produces pleasant looking images which may occasionally be distinguishable</li>
<li>15 means that it produces perfect replicas of some images, and even for larger and more complex images, gives something that is recognizable. Or, perhaps it does not make images that are quite recognizable, but produces beautiful images that are clearly derived from the original.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>3 points</strong> for clever use of the Unicode character set

<ul>
<li>0 points for simply using the entire set of allowed characters</li>
<li>1 point for using a limited set of characters that are safe for transfer over Twitter or in a wider variety of situations</li>
<li>2 points for using a thematic subset of characters, such as only Han ideographs or only right-to-left characters</li>
<li>3 points for doing something really neat, like generating readable text or using characters that look like the image in question</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>3 points</strong> for clever algorithmic approaches and code style

<ul>
<li>0 points for something that is 1000 lines of code only to scale the image down, treat it as 1 bit per pixel, and base64 encode that</li>
<li>1 point for something that uses a standard encoding technique and is well written and brief</li>
<li>2 points for something that introduces a relatively novel encoding technique, or that is surprisingly short and clean</li>
<li>3 points for a one liner that actually produces good results, or something that breaks new ground in graphics encoding (if this seems like a low number of points for breaking new ground, remember that a result this good will likely have a high score for aesthetics as well)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>2 points</strong> for speed. All else being equal, faster is better, but the above criteria are all more important than speed</li>
<li><strong>1 point</strong> for running on free (open source) software, because I prefer free software (note that C# will still be eligible for this point as long as it runs on Mono, likewise MATLAB code would be eligible if it runs on GNU Octave)</li>
<li><strong>1 point</strong> for actually following all of the rules. These rules have gotten a bit big and complicated, so I'll probably accept otherwise good answers that get one small detail wrong, but I will give an extra point to any solution that does actually follow all of the rules</li>
</ul>

<h3>Reference images</h3>

<p>Some folks have asked for some reference images. Here are a few reference images that you can try; smaller versions are embedded here, they all link to larger versions of the image if you need those:</p>

<h3>Prize</h3>

<p>I am offering a <strong>500 rep bounty</strong> (plus the 50 that StackOverflow kicks in) for the solution that I like the best, based on the above criteria. Of course, I encourage everyone else to vote on their favorite solutions here as well.</p>

<h3>Note on deadline</h3>

<p>This contest will run until the bounty runs out, about 6 PM on Saturday, May 30. I can't say the precise time it will end; it may be anywhere from 5 to 7 PM. I will guarantee that I'll look at all entries submitted by 2 PM, and I will do my best to look at all entries submitted by 4 PM; if solutions are submitted after that, I may not have a chance to give them a fair look before I have to make my decision. Also, the earlier you submit, the more chance you will have for voting to be able to help me pick the best solution, so try and submit earlier rather than right at the deadline.</p>

<h3>Unicode notes</h3>

<p>There has also been some confusion on exactly what Unicode characters are allowed. The range of possible Unicode code points is <code>U+0000</code> to <code>U+10FFFF</code>. There are some code points which are never valid to use as Unicode characters in any open interchange of data; these are the <strong>noncharacters</strong> and the <strong>surrogate code points</strong>. Noncharacters are defined in the <a href=""http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode5.0.0/ch16.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Unidode Standard 5.1.0 section 16.7</a> as the values <code>U+FFFE</code>, <code>U+FFFF</code>, <code>U+</code><em>n</em><code>FFFE</code>, <code>U+</code><em>n</em><code>FFFF</code> where <em>n</em> is <code>1</code>–<code>10</code> hexadecimal, and the range <code>U+FDD0</code>–<code>U+FDEF</code>. These values are intended to be used for application-specific internal usage, and conforming applications may strip these characters out of text processed by them. Surrogate code points, defined in the <a href=""http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode5.0.0/ch03.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Unicode Standard 5.1.0 section 3.8</a> as <code>U+D800</code>–<code>U+DFFF</code>, are used for encoding characters beyond the Basic Multilingual Plane in UTF-16; thus, it is impossible to represent these code points directly in the UTF-16 encoding, and it is invalid to encode them in any other encoding. Thus, for the purpose of this contest, I will allow any program which encodes images into a sequence of no more than 140 Unicode code points from the range <code>U+0000</code>–<code>U+10FFFF</code>, excluding all noncharacters and surrogate pairs as defined above.</p>

<p>I will <em>prefer</em> solutions that use only assigned characters, and even better ones that use clever subsets of assigned characters or do something interesting with the character set they use. For a list of assigned characters, see the <a href=""http://unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/UnicodeData.txt"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Unicode Character Database</a>; note that some characters are listed directly, while some are listed only as the start and end of a range. Also note that surrogate code points are listed in the database, but forbidden as mentioned above. If you would like to take advantage of certain properties of characters for making the text you output more interesting, there are a <a href=""http://unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">variety of databases of character information</a> available, such as a <a href=""http://unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/Blocks.txt"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">list of named code blocks</a> and <a href=""http://unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/PropList.txt"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">various character properties</a>.</p>

<p>Since Twitter does not specify the exact character set they support, I will be lenient about solutions which do not actually work with Twitter because certain characters count extra or certain characters are stripped. It is preferred but not required that all encoded outputs should be able to be transferred unharmed via Twitter or another microblogging service such as <a href=""http://identi.ca/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">identi.ca</a>. I have seen some documentation stating that Twitter entity-encodes &lt;, &gt;, and &amp;, and thus counts those as 4, 4, and 5 characters respectively, but I have not tested that out myself, and their JavaScript character counter doesn't seem to count them that way.</p>

<h3>Tips &amp; Links</h3>

<ul>
<li>The definition of valid Unicode characters in the rules is a bit complicated. Choosing a single block of characters, such as CJK Unified Ideographs (U+4E00–U+9FCF) may be easier.</li>
<li>You may use existing image libraries, like <a href=""http://www.imagemagick.org/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ImageMagick</a> or <a href=""http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Python Imaging Library</a>, for your image manipulation.</li>

<li>The earlier you get your solution in, the more time I (and other people voting) will have to look at it. You can edit your solution if you improve it; I'll base my bounty on the most recent version when I take my last look through the solutions.</li>
<li>If you want an easy image format to parse and write (and don't want to just use an existing format), I'd suggest using the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netpbm_format"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">PPM format</a>. It's a text based format that's very easy to work with, and you can use <a href=""http://www.imagemagick.org/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ImageMagick</a> to convert to and from it.</li>

<p>Why does <code>SuperCar.prototype.constructor</code> need to be set back to <code>SuperCar</code>? Is the <code>constructor</code> property overridden when <code>prototype</code> is set? I commented out this line and nothing changed.</p>

<p>I have been working on this for a while now, and I am still confused about the use of finalize and dispose methods in code. My questions are below:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I know that we only need a finalizer while disposing unmanaged resources. However, if there are managed resources that make calls to unmanaged resources, would it still need to implement a finalizer?</p></li>
<li><p>However, if I develop a class that doesn't use any unmanaged resource -  directly or indirectly, should I implement the <code>IDisposable</code> to allow the clients of that class to use the 'using statement'? </p>

<p>Would it be feasible to implement IDisposable just to enable clients of your class to use the using statement?</p>

<pre><code>using(myClass objClass = new myClass())
{
    // Do stuff here
}
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>I have developed this simple code below to demonstrate the Finalize/dispose use:</p>

<pre><code>public class NoGateway : IDisposable
{
    private WebClient wc = null;

    public NoGateway()
    {
        wc = new WebClient();
        wc.DownloadStringCompleted += wc_DownloadStringCompleted;
    }


    // Start the Async call to find if NoGateway is true or false
    public void NoGatewayStatus()
    {
        // Start the Async's download
            // Do other work here
        wc.DownloadStringAsync(new Uri(www.xxxx.xxx));
    }

    private void wc_DownloadStringCompleted(object sender, DownloadStringCompletedEventArgs e)
    {
        // Do work here
    }

    // Dispose of the NoGateway object
    public void Dispose()
    {
        wc.DownloadStringCompleted -= wc_DownloadStringCompleted;
        wc.Dispose();
        GC.SuppressFinalize(this);
    }
}
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<p>Question about the source code:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Here I have not added the finalizer, and normally the finalizer will be called by the GC, and the finalizer will call the Dispose. As I don't have the finalizer, when do I call the Dispose method? Is it the client of the class that has to call it?</p>

<p>So my class in the example is called NoGateway and the client could use and dispose of the class like this:  </p>

<pre><code>using(NoGateway objNoGateway = new NoGateway())
{
    // Do stuff here   
}
</code></pre>

<p>Would the Dispose method be automatically called when execution reaches the end of the using block, or does the client have to manually call the dispose method? i.e.</p>

<pre><code>NoGateway objNoGateway = new NoGateway();
// Do stuff with object
objNoGateway.Dispose(); // finished with it
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>I am using the <code>WebClient</code> class in my <code>NoGateway</code> class. Because <code>WebClient</code> implements the <code>IDisposable</code> interface, does this mean that <code>WebClient</code> indirectly uses unmanaged resources? Is there a hard and fast rule to follow this? How do I know that a class uses unmanaged resources?</p></li>

"910793","<p>I'm reading out lots of texts from various RSS feeds and inserting them into my database.</p>

<p>Of course, there are several different character encodings used in the feeds, e.g. UTF-8 and ISO&nbsp;8859-1.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there are sometimes problems with the encodings of the texts. Example:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The ""ß"" in ""Fußball"" should look like this in my database: ""ÂŸ"". If it is a ""ÂŸ"", it is displayed correctly.</p></li>
<li><p>Sometimes, the ""ß"" in ""Fußball"" looks like this in my database: ""ÃƒÂŸ"". Then it is displayed wrongly, of course.</p></li>
<li><p>In other cases, the ""ß"" is saved as a ""ß"" - so without any change. Then it is also displayed wrongly.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>What can I do to avoid the cases 2 and 3?</p>

<p>How can I make everything the same encoding, preferably UTF-8? When must I use <code>utf8_encode()</code>, when must I use <code>utf8_decode()</code> (it's clear what the effect is but when must I use the functions?) and when must I do nothing with the input?</p>

<p>How do I make everything the same encoding? Perhaps with the function <code>mb_detect_encoding()</code>? Can I write a function for this? So my problems are:</p>

<ol>
<li>How do I find out what encoding the text uses?</li>
<li>How do I convert it to UTF-8 - whatever the old encoding is?</li>
</ol>

<p>Would a function like this work?</p>

<pre><code>function correct_encoding($text) {
    $current_encoding = mb_detect_encoding($text, 'auto');
    $text = iconv($current_encoding, 'UTF-8', $text);
    return $text;

Commonly this is because my change made it upsteam and is coming back to me through a pull, but may be slightly modified in various places.</p>

<p>Is there a command line tool which will get rid of the conflict markers and choose all one way or another based on my choice?  Or a set of git commands which I can alias myself to do each one.</p>

CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in Makefile

randy@sabotage ~/linus $ git checkout Makefile 
error: path 'Makefile' is unmerged

andy@sabotage ~/linus $ git reset --hard HEAD Makefile 
fatal: Cannot do hard reset with paths.

<p>I can do: </p>

<pre><code>git reset HEAD Makefile; rm Makefile; git checkout Makefile

<p>But this seems rather round about, there must be a better way.  And at this point, I'm not sure if git even thinks the merge happened, so I don't think this necessarily even works.</p>

<p>Going the other way, doing 'accept theirs' is equally messy.
The only way I can figure it out is do:</p>

<pre><code>git show test-branch:Makefile &gt; Makefile; git add Makefile;

<p>This also gives me a messed up commit message, which has Conflicts: Makefile in it twice.</p>

"924285","<p>In <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15496/hidden-features-of-java"">Hidden Features of Java</a> the top answer mentions <a href=""http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?DoubleBraceInitialization"" rel=""noreferrer"">Double Brace Initialization</a>, with a <em>very</em> enticing syntax:</p>

<pre><code>Set&lt;String&gt; flavors = new HashSet&lt;String&gt;() {{
    add(""vanilla"");
    add(""strawberry"");
    add(""chocolate"");
    add(""butter pecan"");
}};
</code></pre>

<p>This idiom creates an anonymous inner class with just an instance initializer in it, which ""can use any [...] methods in the containing scope"".  </p>

<p>Main question: Is this as <strong>inefficient</strong> as it sounds?  Should its use be limited to one-off initializations?  (And of course showing off!)</p>

<p>Second question: The new HashSet must be the ""this"" used in the instance initializer ... can anyone shed light on the mechanism?  </p>

<p>Third question: Is this idiom too <strong>obscure</strong> to use in production code?</p>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Very, very nice answers, thanks everyone. On question (3), people felt the syntax should be clear (though I'd recommend an occasional comment, especially if your code will pass on to developers who may not be familiar with it).  </p>

<p>On question (1), the generated code should run quickly. The extra .class files do cause jar file clutter, and slow program startup slightly (thanks to @coobird for measuring that). @Thilo pointed out that garbage collection can be affected, and the memory cost for the extra loaded classes may be a factor in some cases.  </p>

<p>Question (2) turned out to be most interesting to me. If I understand the answers, what's happening in DBI is that the anonymous inner class extends the class of the object being constructed by the new operator, and hence has a ""this"" value referencing the instance being constructed. Very neat.</p>

<p>Overall, DBI strikes me as something of an intellectual curiousity.  Coobird and others point out you can achieve the same effect with Arrays.asList, varargs methods, Google Collections, and the proposed Java 7 Collection literals.  Newer JVM languages like Scala, JRuby, and Groovy also offer concise notations for list construction, and interoperate well with Java.  Given that DBI clutters up the classpath, slows down class loading a bit, and makes the code a tad more obscure, I'd probably shy away from it. However, I plan to spring this on a friend who's just gotten his SCJP and loves good natured jousts about Java semantics!  ;-)  Thanks everyone!</p>

"937313","<p>I want to get <code>fling</code> gesture detection working in my Android application.</p>

<p>What I have is a <code>GridLayout</code> that contains 9 <code>ImageView</code>s. The source can be found here: <a href=""https://github.com/selmanon/apps-for-android/blob/master/Photostream/src/com/google/android/photostream/GridLayout.java"" rel=""noreferrer"">Romain Guys's Grid Layout</a>.</p>

<p>That file I take is from Romain Guy's <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/apps-for-android/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Photostream application</a> and has only been slightly adapted.</p>

<p>For the simple click situation I need only set the <code>onClickListener</code> for each <code>ImageView</code> I add to be the main <code>activity</code> which implements <code>View.OnClickListener</code>. It seems infinitely more complicated to implement something that recognizes a <code>fling</code>. I presume this is because it may span <code>views</code>?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If my activity implements
<code>OnGestureListener</code> I don't know how to
set that as the gesture listener for
the <code>Grid</code> or the <code>Image</code> views that I
add.</p>

<pre><code>public class SelectFilterActivity extends Activity implements
   View.OnClickListener, OnGestureListener { ...
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>If my activity implements
<code>OnTouchListener</code> then I have no
<code>onFling</code> method to <code>override</code> (it has
two events as parameters allowing me
to determine if the fling was
noteworthy).</p>

<pre><code>public class SelectFilterActivity extends Activity implements
    View.OnClickListener, OnTouchListener { ...
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>If I make a custom <code>View</code>, like <code>GestureImageView</code> that extends <code>ImageView</code> I don't know how to tell the activity that a <code>fling</code> has occurred from the view. In any case, I tried this and the methods weren't called when I touched the screen.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I really just need a concrete example of this working across views. What, when and how should I attach this <code>listener</code>? I need to be able to detect single clicks also.</p>

<pre><code>// Gesture detection
mGestureDetector = new GestureDetector(this, new GestureDetector.SimpleOnGestureListener() {

    public boolean onFling(MotionEvent e1, MotionEvent e2, float velocityX, float velocityY) {
        int dx = (int) (e2.getX() - e1.getX());
        // don't accept the fling if it's too short
        // as it may conflict with a button push
        if (Math.abs(dx) &gt; MAJOR_MOVE &amp;&amp; Math.abs(velocityX) &gt; Math.absvelocityY)) {
            if (velocityX &gt; 0) {
                moveRight();
            } else {
                moveLeft();
            }
            return true;
        } else {
            return false;
        }
    }
});
</code></pre>

<p>Is it possible to lay a transparent view over the top of my screen to capture flings?</p>

<p>If I choose not to <code>inflate</code> my child image views from XML can I pass the <code>GestureDetector</code> as a constructor parameter to a new subclass of <code>ImageView</code> that I create?</p>

<p>This is the very simple activity that I'm trying to get the <code>fling</code> detection to work for: <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/miffed/source/browse/GUI/src/uk/ac/ic/doc/gea05/miffed/gui/SelectFilterActivity.java?r=210"" rel=""noreferrer"">SelectFilterActivity (Adapted from photostream)</a>.</p>

<p>I am now adding some error cases, like for instance a client attempts to add a new resource but has exceeded his storage quota. I am already handling certain error cases with HTTP status codes (401 for authentication, 403 for authorization and 404 for plain bad request URIs). I looked over the blessed HTTP error codes but none of the 400-417 range seems right to report application specific errors. So at first I was tempted to return my application error with 200 OK and a specific XML payload (ie. Pay us more and you'll get the storage you need!) but I stopped to think about it and it seems to soapy (/shrug in horror). Besides it feels like I'm splitting the error responses into distinct cases, as some are http status code driven and other are content driven.</p>

"957284","<p>I've programmed in both classic ASP and ASP.NET, and I see different tags inside of the markup for server side code.  </p>

<li><code>&lt;%#</code> (percent sign and hash/pound/octothorpe) </li>

<ul>
<li><code>&lt;%$</code> (percent and dollar sign) and </li>
<li><code>&lt;%@</code> (percent sign and at symbol).</li>
</ul>

<p>I believe <code>&lt;%@</code> loads things like assemblies and perhaps <code>&lt;%$</code> loads things from config files?  I'm not too sure.</p>

"958997","<p>Let's say you don't want other sites to ""frame"" your site in an <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code>:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;iframe src=""http://example.org""&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So you insert anti-framing, frame busting JavaScript into all your pages:</p>

<pre><code>/* break us out of any containing iframes */
if (top != self) { top.location.replace(self.location.href); }
</code></pre>

<p>Excellent! Now you ""bust"" or break out of any containing iframe automatically. Except for one small problem.</p>

<p>As it turns out, <strong>your frame-busting code can be busted</strong>, <a href=""http://coderrr.wordpress.com/2009/02/13/preventing-frame-busting-and-click-jacking-ui-redressing/"" rel=""noreferrer"">as shown here</a>:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;
    var prevent_bust = 0  
    window.onbeforeunload = function() { prevent_bust++ }  
    setInterval(function() {  
      if (prevent_bust &gt; 0) {  
        prevent_bust -= 2  
        window.top.location = 'http://example.org/page-which-responds-with-204'  
      }  
    }, 1)  
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This code does the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>increments a counter every time the browser attempts to navigate away from the current page, via the <code>window.onbeforeunload</code> event handler</li>
<li>sets up a timer that fires every millisecond via <code>setInterval()</code>, and if it sees the counter incremented, changes the current location to a server of the attacker's control</li>
<li>that server serves up a page with HTTP status code <strong>204</strong>, which does not cause the browser to navigate anywhere</li>
</ul>

<p>My question is -- and this is more of a JavaScript puzzle than an actual <em>problem</em> -- how can you defeat the frame-busting buster? </p>

<p>I had a few thoughts, but nothing worked in my testing:</p>

<ul>
<li>attempting to clear the <code>onbeforeunload</code> event via <code>onbeforeunload = null</code> had no effect</li>
<li>adding an <code>alert()</code> stopped the process let the user know it was happening, but did not interfere with the code in any way; clicking OK lets the busting continue as normal</li>
<li>I can't think of any way to clear the <code>setInterval()</code> timer</li>
</ul>

<p>I have a directory that need to be archived with a sub directory that has a number of very large files I do not need to backup.</p>

<p><strong>Not quite solutions:</strong></p>

<p>The <code>tar --exclude=PATTERN</code> command matches the given pattern and excludes those files, but I need specific files &amp; folders to be ignored (full file path), otherwise valid files might be excluded.</p>

<p>I could also use the find command to create a list of files and exclude the ones I don't want to archive and pass the list to tar, but that only works with for a small amount of files. I have tens of thousands.</p>

<p>I'm beginning to think the only solution is to create a file with a list of files/folders to be excluded, then use rsync with <code>--exclude-from=file</code> to copy all the files to a tmp directory, and then use tar to archive that directory.</p>

"1015813","<p>I think I understand the basic concepts of MVC - the Model contains the data and behaviour of the application, the View is responsible for displaying it to the user and the Controller deals with user input. What I'm uncertain about is exactly <em>what</em> goes in the Controller.</p>

<p>Lets say for example I have a fairly simple application (I'm specifically thinking Java, but I suppose the same principles apply elsewhere). I organise my code into 3 packages called <code>app.model</code>, <code>app.view</code> and <code>app.controller</code>.</p>

<p>Within the <code>app.model</code> package, I have a few classes that reflect the actual behaviour of the application. These <code>extends Observable</code> and use <code>setChanged()</code> and <code>notifyObservers()</code> to trigger the views to update when appropriate.</p>

<p>The <code>app.view</code> package has a class (or several classes for different types of display) that uses <code>javax.swing</code> components to handle the display. Some of these components need to feed back into the Model. If I understand correctly, the View shouldn't have anything to do with the feedback - that should be dealt with by the Controller.</p>

<p>So what do I actually put in the Controller? Do I put the <code>public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e)</code> in the View with just a call to a method in the Controller? If so, should any validation etc be done in the Controller? If so, how do I feedback error messages back to the View - should that go through the Model again, or should the Controller just send it straight back to View?</p>

<p>If the validation is done in the View, what do I put in the Controller?</p>

<p>Sorry for the long question, I just wanted to document my understanding of the process and hopefully someone can clarify this issue for me!</p>

<p>Just about every user application I can think of involves state as a core concept.  If you write a document (or a SO post), the state changes with every new input.

"1039853","<p>I mean, aside from its obligating name (the Standard Template Library)...</p>

<p>C++ initially intended to present OOP concepts into C. That is: you could tell what a specific entity could and couldn't do (regardless of how it does it) based on its class and class hierarchy. Some compositions of abilities are more difficult to describe in this manner due to the problematics of multiple inheritance, and the fact that C++ supports the concept of interfaces in a somewhat clumsy way (compared to java, etc), but it's there (and could be improved).</p>

<p>And then templates came into play, along with the STL. The STL seemed to take the classical OOP concepts and flush them down the drain, using templates instead.</p>

<p>There should be a distinction between cases when templates are used to generalize types where the types themeselves are irrelevant for the operation of the template (containers, for examples). Having a <code>vector&lt;int&gt;</code> makes perfect sense.</p>

<p>However, in many other cases (iterators and algorithms), templated types are supposed to follow a ""concept"" (Input Iterator, Forward Iterator, etc...) where the actual details of the concept are defined entirely by the implementation of the template function/class, and not by the class of the type used with the template, which is a somewhat anti-usage of OOP.</p>

<p>For example, you can tell the function:</p>

<pre><code>void MyFunc(ForwardIterator&lt;...&gt; *I);
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> As it was unclear in the original question, ForwardIterator is ok to be templated itself to allow any ForwardIterator type. The contrary is having ForwardIterator as a concept.</p>

<p>expects a Forward Iterator only by looking at its definition, where you'd need either to look at the implementation or the documentation for:</p>

<pre><code>template &lt;typename Type&gt; void MyFunc(Type *I);
</code></pre>

<p>Two claims I can make in favor of using templates: compiled code can be made more efficient, by tailor-compiling the template for each used type, instead of using vtables. And the fact that templates can be used with native types.</p>

<p>However, I am looking for a more profound reason why abandoning classical OOP in favor of templating for the STL? (Assuming you read that far :P)</p>

<p>Later, when the browser is about to make a request, it checks its cookies and filters out the ones it should send for that request. It does so by matching them against the requests path and domain. Question 2: what are the matching rules?

"1064271","<p>I need to do something fairly simple: in my ASP.NET MVC application, I want to set a custom IIdentity / IPrincipal. Whichever is easier / more suitable. I want to extend the default so that I can call something like <code>User.Identity.Id</code> and <code>User.Identity.Role</code>. Nothing fancy, just some extra properties.</p>

<p>I've read tons of articles and questions but I feel like I'm making it harder than it actually is. I thought it would be easy. If a user logs on, I want to set a custom IIdentity. So I thought, I will implement <code>Application_PostAuthenticateRequest</code> in my global.asax. However, that is called on every request, and I don't want to do a call to the database on every request which would request all the data from the database and put in a custom IPrincipal object. That also seems very unnecessary, slow, and in the wrong place (doing database calls there) but I could be wrong. Or where else would that data come from?</p>

<p>So I thought, whenever a user logs in, I can add some necessary variables in my session, which I add to the custom IIdentity in the <code>Application_PostAuthenticateRequest</code> event handler. However, my <code>Context.Session</code> is <code>null</code> there, so that is also not the way to go.</p>

<p>I've been working on this for a day now and I feel I'm missing something. This shouldn't be too hard to do, right? I'm also a bit confused by all the (semi)related stuff that comes with this. <code>MembershipProvider</code>, <code>MembershipUser</code>, <code>RoleProvider</code>, <code>ProfileProvider</code>, <code>IPrincipal</code>, <code>IIdentity</code>, <code>FormsAuthentication</code>.... Am I the only one who finds all this very confusing?</p>

<p>If someone could tell me a simple, elegant, and efficient solution to store some extra data on a IIdentity without all the extra fuzz.. that would be great! I know there are similar questions on SO but if the answer I need is in there, I must've overlooked.</p>

<p>I would like to know if there are any code references that I can follow to write a very simple example. Many posts or websites just talk about the technology. It is hard to find a complete sample code. Also, it seems many methods can be used to implement the comet, e.g. Hidden IFrame, XMLHttpRequest. In my opinion, using XMLHttpRequest is a better choice. What do you think of the pros and cons of different methods? Which one does Gmail use?</p>

<p>I know it needs to do it both in server side and client side.
Is there any PHP and Javascript sample code?</p>

"1089018","<p>There have been several questions posted to SO about floating-point representation. For example, the decimal number 0.1 doesn't have an exact binary representation, so it's dangerous to use the == operator to compare it to another floating-point number. I understand the principles behind floating-point representation.</p>

<p>What I don't understand is why, from a mathematical perspective, are the numbers to the right of the decimal point any more ""special"" that the ones to the left?</p>

<p>For example, the number 61.0 has an exact binary representation because the integral portion of any number is always exact. But the number 6.10 is not exact. All I did was move the decimal one place and suddenly I've gone from Exactopia to Inexactville. Mathematically, there should be no intrinsic difference between the two numbers -- they're just numbers.</p>

<p>By contrast, if I move the decimal one place in the other direction to produce the number 610, I'm still in Exactopia. I can keep going in that direction (6100, 610000000, 610000000000000) and they're still exact, exact, exact. But as soon as the decimal crosses some threshold, the numbers are no longer exact.</p>

<p>What's going on?</p>

<p>Edit: to clarify, I want to stay away from discussion about industry-standard representations, such as IEEE, and stick with what I believe is the mathematically ""pure"" way. In base 10, the positional values are:</p>

<pre><code>... 1000  100   10    1   1/10  1/100 ...
</code></pre>

<p>In binary, they would be:</p>

<pre><code>... 8    4    2    1    1/2  1/4  1/8 ...
</code></pre>

<p>There are also no arbitrary limits placed on these numbers. The positions increase indefinitely to the left and to the right.</p>

<p>I'm making the request in a hidden form, which POSTs to the server, and targets a hidden iframe for its results. This is so I don't replace the entire browser window with the result. I listen for a ""load"" event on the iframe, in the hope that it will fire when the download is complete.</p>

<p>I return a ""Content-Disposition: attachment"" header with the file, which causes the browser to show the ""Save"" dialog. But the browser doesn't fire a ""load"" event in the iframe.</p>

<p>One approach I tried is using a multi-part response. So it would send an empty HTML file, as well as the attached downloadable file. For example:</p>

<pre><code>Content-type: multipart/x-mixed-replace;boundary=""abcde""

--abcde
Content-type: text/html

--abcde
Content-type: application/vnd.fdf
Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=foo.fdf

file-content
--abcde

<p>This works in Firefox; it receives the empty HTML file, fires the ""load"" event, then shows the ""Save"" dialog for the downloadable file. But it fails on IE and Safari; IE fires the ""load"" event but doesn't download the file, and Safari downloads the file (with the wrong name and content-type), and doesn't fire the ""load"" event.</p>

<p>A different approach might be to make a call to start the file creation, then poll the server until it's ready, then download the already-created file. But I'd rather avoid creating temporary files on the server.</p>

"1111980","<p>My program does some network activity in a background thread. Before starting, it pops up a progress dialog. The dialog is dismissed on the handler. This all works fine, except when screen orientation changes while the dialog is up (and the background thread is going).

<p>How can I handle the screen orientation change gracefully?</p>

    public void send() {
         mProgress = ProgressDialog.show(this, ""Please wait"",

        thread.start();
    }

    public void run() {

"1113611","<p>There is a lot of discussions of Python vs Ruby, and I all find them completely unhelpful, because they all turn around why feature X sucks in language Y, or that claim language Y doesn't have X, although in fact it does. I also know exactly why I prefer Python, but that's also subjective, and wouldn't help anybody choosing, as they might not have the same tastes in development as I do.</p>

<p>It would therefore be interesting to list the differences, objectively. So no ""Python's lambdas sucks"". Instead explain what Ruby's lambdas can do that Python's can't. No subjectivity. Example code is good!</p>

<p>Don't have several differences in one answer, please. And vote up the ones you know are correct, and down those you know are incorrect (or are subjective). Also, differences in syntax is not interesting. We know Python does with indentation what Ruby does with brackets and ends, and that @ is called self in Python.</p>

<p>UPDATE: This is now a community wiki, so we can add the big differences here.</p>

<h2>Ruby has a class reference in the class body</h2>

<p>In Ruby you have a reference to the class (self) already in the class body. In Python you don't have a reference to the class until after the class construction is finished.</p>

<p>An example:</p>

<pre><code>class Kaka
  puts self
end
</code></pre>

<p>self in this case is the class, and this code would print out ""Kaka"". There is no way to print out the class name or in other ways access the class from the class definition body in Python (outside method definitions).</p>

<h2>All classes are mutable in Ruby</h2>

<p>This lets you develop extensions to core classes.  Here's an example of a rails extension:</p>

<pre><code>class String
  def starts_with?(other)
    head = self[0, other.length]
    head == other
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Python (imagine there were no <code>''.startswith</code> method):</p>

<pre><code>def starts_with(s, prefix):
    return s[:len(prefix)] == prefix
</code></pre>

<p>You could use it on any sequence (not just strings). In order to use it you should import it <em>explicitly</em> e.g., <code>from some_module import starts_with</code>.</p>

<h2>Ruby has Perl-like scripting features</h2>

<p>Ruby has first class regexps, $-variables, the awk/perl line by line input loop and other features that make it more suited to writing small shell scripts that munge text files or act as glue code for other programs.</p>

<h2>Ruby has first class continuations</h2>

<p>Thanks to the callcc statement. In Python you can create continuations by various techniques, but there is no support built in to the language.</p>

<h2>Ruby has blocks</h2>

<p>With the ""do"" statement you can create a multi-line anonymous function in Ruby, which will be passed in as an argument into the method in front of do, and called from there. In Python you would instead do this either by passing a method or with generators.</p>

<p>Ruby:</p>

<pre><code>amethod { |here|
    many=lines+of+code
    goes(here)
}
</code></pre>

<p>Python (Ruby blocks correspond to different constructs in Python):</p>

<pre><code>with amethod() as here: # `amethod() is a context manager
    many=lines+of+code
    goes(here)
</code></pre>

<p>Or</p>

<pre><code>for here in amethod(): # `amethod()` is an iterable
    many=lines+of+code
    goes(here)
</code></pre>

<p>Or</p>

<pre><code>def function(here):
    many=lines+of+code
    goes(here)

amethod(function)     # `function` is a callback
</code></pre>

<p>Interestingly, the convenience statement in Ruby for calling a block is called ""yield"", which in Python will create a generator.</p>

<p>Ruby:</p>

<pre><code>def themethod
    yield 5
end

themethod do |foo|
    puts foo
end
</code></pre>

<p>Python:</p>

<pre><code>def themethod():
    yield 5

for foo in themethod():
    print foo
</code></pre>

<p>Although the principles are different, the result is strikingly similar.</p>

<h2>Ruby supports functional style (pipe-like) programming more easily</h2>

<pre><code>myList.map(&amp;:description).reject(&amp;:empty?).join(""\n"")
</code></pre>

<p>Python:</p>

<pre><code>descriptions = (f.description() for f in mylist)
""\n"".join(filter(len, descriptions))
</code></pre>

<h2>Python has built-in generators (which are used like Ruby blocks, as noted above)</h2>

<p>Python has support for generators in the language. In Ruby 1.8 you can use the generator module which uses continuations to create a generator from a block. Or, you could just use a block/proc/lambda! Moreover, in Ruby 1.9 Fibers are, and can be used as, generators, and the Enumerator class is a built-in generator <a href=""http://wiki.github.com/rdp/ruby_tutorials_core/enumerator"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">4</a></p>

<p><a href=""http://docs.python.org/tutorial/classes.html#generators"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">docs.python.org</a> has this generator example:</p>

<pre><code>def reverse(data):
    for index in range(len(data)-1, -1, -1):
        yield data[index]
</code></pre>

<p>Contrast this with the above block examples.</p>

<h2>Python has flexible name space handling</h2>

<p>In Ruby, when you import a file with <code>require</code>, all the things defined in that file will end up in your global namespace. This causes namespace pollution. The solution to that is Rubys modules. But if you create a namespace with a module, then you have to use that namespace to access the contained classes.</p>

<p>In Python, the file is a module, and you can import its contained names with <code>from themodule import *</code>, thereby polluting the namespace if you want. But you can also import just selected names with <code>from themodule import aname, another</code> or you can simply <code>import themodule</code> and then access the names with <code>themodule.aname</code>. If you want more levels in your namespace you can have packages, which are directories with modules and an <code>__init__.py</code> file.</p>

<h2>Python has docstrings</h2>

<p>Docstrings are strings that are attached to modules, functions and methods and can be
introspected at runtime. This helps for creating such things as the help command and
automatic documentation.</p>

<pre><code>def frobnicate(bar):
    """"""frobnicate takes a bar and frobnicates it

       &gt;&gt;&gt; bar = Bar()
       &gt;&gt;&gt; bar.is_frobnicated()
       False
       &gt;&gt;&gt; frobnicate(bar)
       &gt;&gt;&gt; bar.is_frobnicated()
       True
    """"""
</code></pre>

<p>Ruby's equivalent are similar to javadocs, and located above the method instead of within it.  They can be retrieved at runtime from the files by using 1.9's Method#source_location <a href=""http://github.com/rdp/ri_for"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"" title=""example use"">example use</a></p>

<h2>Python has multiple inheritance</h2>

<p>Ruby does not (""on purpose"" -- see Ruby's website, <a href=""http://codeidol.com/other/rubyckbk/Modules-and-Namespaces/Simulating-Multiple-Inheritance-with-Mixins/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">see here how it's done in Ruby</a>). It does reuse the module concept as a type of abstract classes.</p>

<h2>Python has list/dict comprehensions</h2>

<p>Python:</p>

<pre><code>res = [x*x for x in range(1, 10)]
</code></pre>

<p>Ruby:</p>

<pre><code>res = (0..9).map { |x| x * x }
</code></pre>

<p>Python:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; (x*x for x in range(10))
&lt;generator object &lt;genexpr&gt; at 0xb7c1ccd4&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; list(_)
[0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]
</code></pre>

<p>Ruby:</p>

<pre><code>p = proc { |x| x * x }
(0..9).map(&amp;p)
</code></pre>

<p>Python <strong>2.7+</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; {x:str(y*y) for x,y in {1:2, 3:4}.items()}
{1: '4', 3: '16'}
</code></pre>

<p>Ruby:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt; Hash[{1=&gt;2, 3=&gt;4}.map{|x,y| [x,(y*y).to_s]}]
=&gt; {1=&gt;""4"", 3=&gt;""16""}
</code></pre>

<h2>Python has decorators</h2>

<p>Things similar to decorators can also be created in Ruby, and it can also be argued that they aren't as necessary as in Python.</p>

<h2>Syntax differences</h2>

<p>Ruby requires ""end"" or ""}"" to close all of its scopes, while Python uses white-space only.  There have been recent attempts in Ruby to allow for whitespace only indentation <a href=""http://github.com/michaeledgar/seamless"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://github.com/michaeledgar/seamless</a></p>

<p>In the above code, is new int[100] generating the array on the heap? From what I've read on CLR via c#, the answer is yes. But what I can't understand, is what happens to the actual int's inside the array. As they are value types, I'd guess they'd have to be boxed, as I can, for example, pass myIntegers to other parts of the program and it'd clutter up the stack if they were left on it all the time. Or am I wrong? I'd guess they'd just be boxed and would live on the heap for as long the array existed.</p>

"1115876","<p>In a nutshell, I'm searching for a <strong>working</strong> autocompletion feature for the Vim editor. I've <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24109/c-ide-for-linux/24119#24119"">argued before</a> that Vim completely replaces an IDE under Linux and while that's certainly true, it lacks one important feature: autocompletion.</p>

<p>I know about <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>N</kbd>, <a href=""http://ctags.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Exuberant Ctags integration</a>, <a href=""http://vim-taglist.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Taglist</a>, <a href=""http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=527"" rel=""noreferrer"">cppcomplete</a> and <a href=""http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1520"" rel=""noreferrer"">OmniCppComplete</a>. Alas, none of these fits my description of “working autocompletion:”</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>N</kbd></strong> works nicely (only) if you've forgotton how to spell <code>class</code>, or <code>while</code>. Oh well.</li>
<li><strong>Ctags</strong> gives you the rudiments but has a lot of drawbacks.</li>
<li><strong>Taglist</strong> is just a Ctags wrapper and as such, inherits most of its drawbacks (although it works well for <em>listing</em> declarations).</li>
<li><strong>cppcomplete</strong> simply doesn't work as promised, and I can't figure out what I did wrong, or if it's “working” correctly and the limitations are by design.</li>
<li><strong>OmniCppComplete</strong> seems to have the same problems as cppcomplete, i.e. auto-completion doesn't work properly. Additionally, the <code>tags</code> file once again needs to be updated manually.</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm aware of the fact that not even modern, full-blown IDEs offer good C++ code completion. That's why I've accepted Vim's lack in this area until now. But I think a fundamental level of code completion isn't too much to ask, and is in fact required for productive usage. So I'm searching for something that can accomplish at least the following things.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Syntax awareness</strong>. cppcomplete promises (but doesn't deliver for me), correct, scope-aware auto-completion of the following:</p>

<pre><code>variableName.abc
variableName-&gt;abc
typeName::abc
</code></pre>

<p>And really, anything else is completely useless.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Configurability</strong>. I need to specify (easily) where the source files are, and hence where the script gets its auto-completion information from. In fact, I've got a Makefile in my directory which specifies the required include paths. Eclipse can interpret the information found therein, why not a Vim script as well?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Up-to-dateness</strong>. As soon as I change something in my file, I want the auto-completion to reflect this. I do <em>not</em> want to manually trigger <code>ctags</code> (or something comparable). Also, changes should be <em>incremental</em>, i.e. when I've changed just one file it's completely <em>unacceptable</em> for <code>ctags</code> to re-parse the whole directory tree (which may be huge).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Did I forget anything? Feel free to update.</p>

<p>I'm comfortable with quite a lot of configuration and/or tinkering but I don't want to program a solution from scratch, and I'm not good at debugging Vim scripts.</p>

<p>A final note, I'd really like something similar for Java and C# but I guess that's too much to hope for: <code>ctags</code> only parses code files and both Java and C# have huge, precompiled frameworks that would need to be indexed. Unfortunately, <a href=""http://greengoo.de/243/developing-dotnet-without-an-ide"" rel=""noreferrer"">developing .NET without an IDE</a> is even more of a PITA than C++.</p>

<p>I can appreciate that a greasemonkey script would want to bundle anything it can within the source as opposed to host it on a server, that's obvious enough. But since I had not seen this technique previously, I considered its use and it seems appealing for a number of reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li>It will reduce the amount of HTTP requests on page load, thus enhancing performance</li>
<li>If no CDN, then it will reduce the amount of traffic generated through cookies being sent alongside of images</li>
<li>CSS files can be cached</li>
<li>CSS files can be GZIPPED </li>
</ol>

<p>Considering that IE6 (for instance) has problems with cache for background images, this seems like it's not the worst idea...</p>

<p>So, is this a good or bad practice, why WOULDN'T you use it and what tools would you use to base64 encode the images?</p>

"1126726","<p>With the iOS SDK:</p>

<p>I have a <code>UIView</code> with <code>UITextField</code>s that bring up a keyboard. I need it to be able to:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Allow scrolling of the contents of the <code>UIScrollView</code> to see the other text fields once the keyboard is brought up</p></li>
<li><p>Automatically ""jump"" (by scrolling up) or shortening</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I know that I need a <code>UIScrollView</code>.  I've tried changing the class of my <code>UIView</code> to a <code>UIScrollView</code> but I'm still unable to scroll the textboxes up or down.  </p>

<p>Do I need both a <code>UIView</code> and a <code>UIScrollView</code>?  Does one go inside the other?</p>

<p>What needs to be implemented in order to automatically scroll to the active text field?</p>

<p>Ideally as much of the setup of the components as possible will be done in Interface Builder. I'd like to only write code for what needs it.</p>

<p>Note: the <code>UIView</code> (or <code>UIScrollView</code>) that I'm working with is brought up by a tabbar (<code>UITabBar</code>), which needs to function as normal.</p>

<hr>

<p>Edit: I am adding the scroll bar just for when the keyboard comes up.  Even though it's not needed, I feel like it provides a better interface because then the user can scroll and change textboxes, for example.  </p>

<p>I've got it working where I change the frame size of the <code>UIScrollView</code> when the keyboard goes up and down. I'm simply using: </p>

<pre><code>-(void)textFieldDidBeginEditing:(UITextField *)textField { 
    //Keyboard becomes visible
    scrollView.frame = CGRectMake(scrollView.frame.origin.x, 
                     scrollView.frame.origin.y, 
scrollView.frame.size.width,
scrollView.frame.size.height - 215 + 50);   //resize
}

-(void)textFieldDidEndEditing:(UITextField *)textField {
   //keyboard will hide
    scrollView.frame = CGRectMake(scrollView.frame.origin.x, 
       scrollView.frame.origin.y, 
     scrollView.frame.size.width,
      scrollView.frame.size.height + 215 - 50); //resize
}
</code></pre>

<p>However, this doesn't automatically ""move up"" or center the lower text fields in the visible area, which is what I would really like.</p>

<li><strong>MyWebProject1</strong> &lt;- this web application project has a reference to MyBaseProject</li>

<p>I added the elmah.dll reference to <strong>MyBaseProject</strong> in Visual studio 2008 by clicking ""Add reference..."" → ""Browse"" tab → selecting the ""elmah.dll"".</p>

<li>Resolved - True</li>

<li>Specified version - false</li>
<li>Strong Name - false</li>
<li>Version - 1.0.11211.0</li>
</ul>

<p>In <strong>MyWebProject1</strong> I added the reference to Project MyBaseProject by:
""Add reference..."" → ""Projects"" tab → selecting the ""MyBaseProject"". The Properties of this reference are the same except the following members:</p>

<ul>
<li>Description -</li>
<li>Path - D:\webs\CMS\MyBaseProject\bin\Debug\MyBaseProject.dll</li>
<li>Version - 1.0.0.0</li>
</ul>

<p>If I run the build in <strong>Visual Studio</strong> the elmah.dll file is copied to my <strong>MyWebProject1's bin</strong> directory, along with MyBaseProject.dll!</p>

<p>However if I clean and run <strong>MSBuild</strong> for the solution (via D:\webs\CMS> C:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v3.5\MSBuild.exe /t:ReBuild /p:Configuration=Debug MyProject.sln)
the <strong>elmah.dll is missing</strong> in MyWebProject1's bin directory - although the build itself contains no warning or errors!</p>

<p>I already made sure that the .csproj of MyBaseProject contains the <strong>private</strong> element with the value ""true"" (that should be an alias for ""<strong>copy local</strong>"" in Visual Studio):</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Reference Include=""Elmah, Version=1.0.11211.0, Culture=neutral, processorArchitecture=MSIL""&gt;
  &lt;SpecificVersion&gt;False&lt;/SpecificVersion&gt;

    **&lt;Private&gt;true&lt;/Private&gt;**
&lt;/Reference&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>(The private tag didn't appear in the .csproj's xml by default, although Visual Studio said ""copy local"" true. I switched ""copy local"" to false - saved - and set it back to true again - save!)</p>

<p>A manager of mine once had his first encounter with this feature, and called it ""a dramatic design flaw"" of the language. I replied that the behavior had an underlying explanation, and it is indeed very puzzling and unexpected if you don't understand the internals. However, I was not able to answer (to myself) the following question: what is the reason for binding the default argument at function definition, and not at function execution? I doubt the experienced behavior has a practical use (who really used static variables in C, without breeding bugs?)</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: </p>

<p>Baczek made an interesting example. Together with most of your comments and Utaal's in particular, I elaborated further:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; def a():
...     print(""a executed"")
...     return []
... 
&gt;&gt;&gt;            
&gt;&gt;&gt; def b(x=a()):
...     x.append(5)
...     print(x)
... 
a executed
&gt;&gt;&gt; b()
[5]
&gt;&gt;&gt; b()
[5, 5]
</code></pre>

<p>To me, it seems that the design decision was relative to where to put the scope of parameters: inside the function or ""together"" with it?</p>

<p>Doing the binding inside the function would mean that <code>x</code> is effectively bound to the specified default when the function is called, not defined, something that would present a deep flaw: the <code>def</code> line would be ""hybrid"" in the sense that part of the binding (of the function object) would happen at definition, and part (assignment of default parameters) at function invocation time.</p>

<p>The actual behavior is more consistent: everything of that line gets evaluated when that line is executed, meaning at function definition.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Microsoft NetMeeting takes <code>callto:</code> schemes under WinXP. <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1009181/url-scheme-for-phone-call"">This question</a> suggests, that Microsoft Office Communicator will handle <code>tel:</code> schemes but not <code>callto:</code> ones. Great, Redmond!</p>

<p><strong>Update 2:</strong> Two and a half years later now. It seems to boil down to what you want to do with the number. In mobile context, <code>tel:</code> is the way to go. Targeting desktops it's up to you, if you think your users are more Skype people (<code>callto:</code>) or will more likely have something like Google Voice (<code>tel:</code>) installed. My personal opinion is, when in doubt use <code>tel:</code> (in line with @Sidnicious' answer).</p>

<p><strong>Update 3:</strong> User @rybo111 noted, that Skype in Chrome has meanwhile jumped on the <code>tel:</code> bandwagon. I cannot verify this, because no machine with both at hand, but if it's true, it means we have finally a winner here: <code>tel:</code></p>

"1168345","<p>Java requires that if you call this() or super() in a constructor, it must be the first statement. Why?</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>public class MyClass {
    public MyClass(int x) {}
}

public class MySubClass extends MyClass {
    public MySubClass(int a, int b) {
        int c = a + b;
        super(c);  // COMPILE ERROR
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The Sun compiler says ""call to super must be first statement in constructor"". The Eclipse compiler says ""Constructor call must be the first statement in a constructor"".</p>

<p>However, you can get around this by re-arranging the code a little bit:</p>

<pre><code>public class MySubClass extends MyClass {
    public MySubClass(int a, int b) {
        super(a + b);  // OK
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here is another example:</p>

<pre><code>public class MyClass {
    public MyClass(List list) {}
}

public class MySubClassA extends MyClass {
    public MySubClassA(Object item) {
        // Create a list that contains the item, and pass the list to super
        List list = new ArrayList();
        list.add(item);
        super(list);  // COMPILE ERROR
    }
}

public class MySubClassB extends MyClass {
    public MySubClassB(Object item) {
        // Create a list that contains the item, and pass the list to super
        super(Arrays.asList(new Object[] { item }));  // OK
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>So, it is <strong>not stopping you from executing logic</strong> before the call to super. It is just stopping you from executing logic that you can't fit into a single expression.</p>

<p>There are similar rules for calling <code>this()</code>. The compiler says ""call to this must be first statement in constructor"".</p>

<p>Why does the compiler have these restrictions? Can you give a code example where, if the compiler did not have this restriction, something bad would happen?</p>

"1174169","<p>I'm looking for the rules involving passing C++ templates functions as arguments.</p>

<p>This is supported by C++ as shown by an example here:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;

void add1(int &amp;v)
{
  v+=1;
}

void add2(int &amp;v)
{
  v+=2;
}

template &lt;void (*T)(int &amp;)&gt;
void doOperation()
{
  int temp=0;
  T(temp);
  std::cout &lt;&lt; ""Result is "" &lt;&lt; temp &lt;&lt; std::endl;
}

int main()
{
  doOperation&lt;add1&gt;();
  doOperation&lt;add2&gt;();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Learning about this technique is difficult, however. <a href=""http://www.google.com/search?q=function+as+template+argument"" rel=""noreferrer"">Googling for ""function as a template argument""</a> doesn't lead to much. And the classic <a href=""https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/0201734842"" rel=""noreferrer"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">C++ Templates The Complete Guide</a> surprisingly also doesn't discuss it (at least not from my search).</p>

<p>The questions I have are whether this is valid C++ (or just some widely supported extension).</p>

<p>Also, is there a way to allow a functor with the same signature to be used interchangeably with explicit functions during this kind of template invocation?</p>

<p>The following does <strong>not</strong> work in the above program, at least in <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_C%2B%2B#32-bit_versions"" rel=""noreferrer"">Visual C++</a>, because the syntax is obviously wrong. It'd be nice to be able to switch out a function for a functor and vice versa, similar to the way you can pass a function pointer or functor to the std::sort algorithm if you want to define a custom comparison operation.</p>

<pre><code>   struct add3 {
      void operator() (int &amp;v) {v+=3;}
   };
...

    doOperation&lt;add3&gt;();
</code></pre>

"1189911","<p>I'm interested in hearing about design strategies you have used with <strong>non-relational ""nosql"" databases</strong> - that is, the (mostly new) class of data stores that don't use traditional relational design or SQL (such as Hypertable, CouchDB, SimpleDB, Google App Engine datastore, Voldemort, Cassandra, SQL Data Services, etc.). They're also often referred to as ""key/value stores"", and at base they act like giant distributed persistent hash tables.</p>

<p>Specifically, I want to learn about the differences in <em>conceptual data design</em> with these new databases. What's easier, what's harder, what can't be done at all?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Have you come up with alternate designs that work much better in the non-relational world?</p></li>
<li><p>Have you hit your head against anything that seems impossible? </p></li>
<li><p>Have you bridged the gap with any design patterns, e.g. to translate from one to the other? </p></li>
<li><p>Do you even do explicit data models at all now (e.g. in UML) or have you chucked them entirely in favor of semi-structured / document-oriented data blobs?</p></li>
<li><p>Do you miss any of the major extra services that RDBMSes provide, like relational integrity, arbitrarily complex transaction support, triggers, etc?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I come from a SQL relational DB background, so normalization is in my blood. That said, I get the advantages of non-relational databases for simplicity and scaling, and my gut tells me that there has to be a richer overlap of design capabilities. What have you done?</p>

<p>So the gospel on pulling associated records that you know you're going to use is to use <code>:include</code> because you'll get a join and avoid a whole bunch of extra queries:</p>

<pre><code>Post.all(:include =&gt; :comments)
</code></pre>

<p>However when you look at the logs, there's no join happening:</p>

<pre><code>Post Load (3.7ms)   SELECT * FROM ""posts""
Comment Load (0.2ms)   SELECT ""comments.*"" FROM ""comments"" 
                       WHERE (""comments"".post_id IN (1,2,3,4)) 
                       ORDER BY created_at asc) 
</code></pre>

<p>It <em>is</em> taking a shortcut because it pulls all of the comments at once, but it's still not a join (which is what all the documentation seems to say). The only way I can get a join is to use <code>:joins</code> instead of <code>:include</code>:</p>

<pre><code>Post.all(:joins =&gt; :comments)
</code></pre>

<p>And the logs show:</p>

<pre><code>Post Load (6.0ms)  SELECT ""posts"".* FROM ""posts"" 
                   INNER JOIN ""comments"" ON ""posts"".id = ""comments"".post_id
</code></pre>

<p>Am I missing something? I have an app with half a dozen associations and on one screen I display data from all of them. Seems like it would be better to have one join-ed query instead of 6 individuals. I know that performance-wise it's not always better to do a join rather than individual queries (in fact if you're going by time spent, it looks like the two individual queries above are faster than the join), but after all the docs I've been reading I'm surprised to see <code>:include</code> not working as advertised.</p>

<p>Maybe Rails <em>is</em> cognizant of the performance issue and doesn't join except in certain cases?</p>

"1218390","<p>I've heard a lot about <a href=""http://www.vim.org/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Vim</a>, both pros and cons.
It really seems you should be (as a developer) faster with Vim than with any other editor.
I'm using Vim to do some basic stuff and I'm at best 10 times <em>less productive</em> with Vim.</p>

<p>The only two things you should care about when you talk about speed (you may not care enough about them, but you should) are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Using alternatively left and right
hands is the <strong>fastest</strong> way to use the
keyboard. </li>
<li>Never touching the mouse is the
second way to be as fast as possible.
It takes ages for you to move your hand,
grab the mouse, move it, and bring it
back to the keyboard (and you often have
to look at the keyboard to be sure you
returned your hand properly to the right place)</li>
</ol>

<p>Here are two examples demonstrating why I'm far less productive with Vim.</p>

<p><strong>Copy/Cut &amp; paste.</strong> I do it all the time. With all the contemporary editors you press <kbd>Shift</kbd>  with the left hand, and you move the cursor with your right hand to select text. Then <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> copies, you move the cursor and <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>V</kbd> pastes.</p>

<p>With Vim it's horrible:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><code>yy</code></strong> to copy one line (you almost never want the whole line!)</li>
<li><strong><code>[number xx]yy</code></strong> to copy <code>xx</code> lines into the buffer. But you never know exactly if you've selected what you wanted. I often have to do <strong><code>[number xx]dd</code></strong> then <strong><code>u</code></strong> to undo!</li>
</ul>

<p>Another example? <strong>Search &amp; replace.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>In <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSPad"" rel=""noreferrer"">PSPad</a>: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>f</kbd> then type what you want you search for, then press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.</li>
<li>In Vim: <strong><code>/</code></strong>, then type what you want to search for, then if there are some special characters put <strong><code>\</code></strong> before <em>each</em> special character, then press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.</li>
</ul>

<p>And everything with Vim is like that: it seems I don't know how to handle it the right way.</p>

<p>NB : <strong>I've already read the Vim <a href=""http://www.viemu.com/vi-vim-cheat-sheet.gif"" rel=""noreferrer"">cheat</a> <a href=""http://www.fprintf.net/vimCheatSheet.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">sheet</a></strong> :)</p>

"1230571","<p>We are developing an ASP.NET MVC application, and are now building the repository/service classes.  I'm wondering if there are any major advantages to creating a generic IRepository interface that all repositories implement, vs. each Repository having its own unique interface and set of methods.</p>

<p>For example: a generic IRepository interface might look like (taken from <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/291344/repository-pattern-vs-dal"">this answer</a>):</p>

<pre><code>public interface IRepository : IDisposable
{
    T[] GetAll&lt;T&gt;();
    T[] GetAll&lt;T&gt;(Expression&lt;Func&lt;T, bool&gt;&gt; filter);
    T GetSingle&lt;T&gt;(Expression&lt;Func&lt;T, bool&gt;&gt; filter);
    T GetSingle&lt;T&gt;(Expression&lt;Func&lt;T, bool&gt;&gt; filter, List&lt;Expression&lt;Func&lt;T, object&gt;&gt;&gt; subSelectors);
    void Delete&lt;T&gt;(T entity);
    void Add&lt;T&gt;(T entity);
    int SaveChanges();
    DbTransaction BeginTransaction();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Each Repository would implement this interface, for example:</p>

<ul>
<li>CustomerRepository:IRepository</li>
<li>ProductRepository:IRepository</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>The alternate that we've followed in prior projects would be:</p>

<pre><code>public interface IInvoiceRepository : IDisposable
{
    EntityCollection&lt;InvoiceEntity&gt; GetAllInvoices(int accountId);
    EntityCollection&lt;InvoiceEntity&gt; GetAllInvoices(DateTime theDate);
    InvoiceEntity GetSingleInvoice(int id, bool doFetchRelated);
    InvoiceEntity GetSingleInvoice(DateTime invoiceDate, int accountId); //unique
    InvoiceEntity CreateInvoice();
    InvoiceLineEntity CreateInvoiceLine();
    void SaveChanges(InvoiceEntity); //handles inserts or updates
    void DeleteInvoice(InvoiceEntity);
    void DeleteInvoiceLine(InvoiceLineEntity);
}
</code></pre>

<p>In the second case, the expressions (LINQ or otherwise) would be entirely contained in the Repository implementation, whoever is implementing the service just needs to know which repository function to call.  </p>

<p>I guess I don't see the advantage of writing all the expression syntax in the service class and passing to the repository.  Wouldn't this mean easy-to-messup LINQ code is being duplicated in many cases?  </p>

<p>For example, in our old invoicing system, we call</p>

<pre><code>InvoiceRepository.GetSingleInvoice(DateTime invoiceDate, int accountId)
</code></pre>

<p>from a few different services (Customer, Invoice, Account, etc).  That seems much cleaner than writing the following in multiple places:</p>

<pre><code>rep.GetSingle(x =&gt; x.AccountId = someId &amp;&amp; x.InvoiceDate = someDate.Date);
</code></pre>

<p>The only disadvantage I see to using the specific approach is that we could end up with many permutations of Get* functions, but this still seems preferable to pushing the expression logic up into the Service classes.</p>

  of a clustered index contain the data
  pages. A nonclustered index is a

I should mention I'm completely new to Java. JSP files seem to make it easy to work with common includes and variables, much like <code>PHP</code>, but I'd like to know a simple way to get something like template inheritance (<code>Django</code> style) or at least be able to have a base.jsp file containing the header and the footer, so I can insert content later.</p>

<p><em>Ben Lings</em> seems to offer some hope in his answer here:

<p><em>Thanks.</em></p>

<p><strong>edit:</strong> I don't want to use any external libraries, because it would increase the learning curve for myself and others who work on the project, and the company I work for has been contracted to do this.</p>

<p><strong>Another edit:</strong> I'm not sure if <code>JSP tags</code> will be useful because my content doesn't really have any template variables. What I need is a way to be able to do this:</p>

<p><code>base.html:</code></p>

{ content.body }

"1300088","<p>Right, so I have an enumerable and wish to get distinct values from it.</p>

<p>Using <code>System.Linq</code>, there's of course an extension method called <code>Distinct</code>. In the simple case, it can be used with no parameters, like:</p>

<pre><code>var distinctValues = myStringList.Distinct();
</code></pre>

<p>Well and good, but if I have an enumerable of objects for which I need to specify equality, the only available overload is:</p>

<pre><code>var distinctValues = myCustomerList.Distinct(someEqualityComparer);
</code></pre>

<p>The equality comparer argument must be an instance of <code>IEqualityComparer&lt;T&gt;</code>. I can do this, of course, but it's somewhat verbose and, well, cludgy.</p>

<p>What I would have expected is an overload that would take a lambda, say a Func&lt;T, T, bool&gt;:</p>

<pre><code>var distinctValues
    = myCustomerList.Distinct((c1, c2) =&gt; c1.CustomerId == c2.CustomerId);
</code></pre>

<p>Anyone know if some such extension exists, or some equivalent workaround? Or am I missing something?</p>

<p>Alternatively, is there a way of specifying an IEqualityComparer inline (embarass me)?</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>I found a reply by Anders Hejlsberg to a <a href=""http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/linqprojectgeneral/thread/6834054e-e1c1-49db-970c-370a9012c675"" rel=""noreferrer"">post</a> in an MSDN forum on this subject. He says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The problem you're going to run into is that when two objects compare
  equal they must have the same GetHashCode return value (or else the
  hash table used internally by Distinct will not function correctly).
  We use IEqualityComparer because it packages compatible
  implementations of Equals and GetHashCode into a single interface.</p>

<ul>
<li>I have a Django model with an ImageField on it</li>
<li>I have code that downloads an image via HTTP (tested and works)</li>
<li>The image is saved directly into the 'upload_to' folder (the upload_to being the one that is set on the ImageField)</li>
<li>All I need to do is associate the already existing image file path with the ImageField</li>
</ul>

<p>I've written this code about 6 different ways.</p>

<p>The problem I'm running into is all of the code that I'm writing results in the following behavior:
(1) Django will make a 2nd file, (2) rename the new file, adding an _ to the end of the file name, then (3) not transfer any of the data over leaving it basically an empty re-named file.  What's left in the 'upload_to' path is 2 files, one that is the actual image, and one that is the name of the image,but is empty, and of course the ImageField path is set to the empty file that Django try to create.</p>

<p>In case that was unclear, I'll try to illustrate:</p>

<pre><code>## Image generation code runs.... 
/Upload
     generated_image.jpg     4kb

## Attempt to set the ImageField path...
/Upload
     generated_image.jpg     4kb
     generated_image_.jpg    0kb

ImageField.Path = /Upload/generated_image_.jpg
</code></pre>

<p>How can I do this without having Django try to re-store the file?  What I'd really like is something to this effect...</p>

<pre><code>model.ImageField.path = generated_image_path
</code></pre>

<p>...but of course that doesn't work.</p>

<p>And yes I've gone through the other questions here like <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/811167/how-to-manually-assign-imagefield-in-django"">this one</a> as well as the django doc on <a href=""http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/files/file/#django.core.files.File.save"" rel=""noreferrer"">File</a></p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>
After further testing, it only does this behavior when running under Apache on Windows Server.  While running under the 'runserver' on XP it does not execute this behavior. </p>

<p>By ""modern Python"" I mean something that will run in Python 2.5 but be 'correct' for the Python 2.6 and Python 3.* way of doing things. And by ""custom"" I mean an Exception object that can include extra data about the cause of the error: a string, maybe also some other arbitrary object relevant to the exception.</p>

...         self.message = message
...

I gather from <A href=""http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0352/"" rel=""noreferrer"">PEP-352</a> that attribute did have a special meaning in 2.5 they're trying to deprecate away, so I guess that name (and that one alone) is now forbidden?

<li>Ash made me consider not having my API accept <code>Date</code> instances at all, this would be easiest to validate.</li>
<li>Borgar suggested testing for a <code>Date</code> instance, and then testing for the <code>Date</code>'s time value. If the date is invalid, the time value is <code>NaN</code>.

"1384325","<p>While helping a friend with a git problem today, I had to introduce a
branch that needed to be totally separate from the <code>master</code> branch.
The contents of this branch really had a different origin from what
had been developed on the <code>master</code> branch, but they were going to be
merged into the <code>master</code> branch at a later time.</p>

<p>I remembered from reading John Wiegley's <a href=""http://ftp.newartisans.com/pub/git.from.bottom.up.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">Git from the bottom
up</a> how
branches are essentially a label to a commit that follows a certain
convention and how a commit is tied to a tree of files and, optionally
to parent commits. We went to create a parentless commit to the
existing repository using git's plumbing:</p>

<p>So we got rid of all files in the index ...</p>

<pre><code>$ git rm -rf .
</code></pre>

<p>... extracted directories and files from a tarball, added those to the
index ...</p>

<pre><code>$ git add .
</code></pre>

<p>... and created a tree object ...</p>

<pre><code>$ git write-tree
</code></pre>

<p>(<code>git-write-tree</code> told us the sha1sum of the created tree object.)</p>

<p>Then, We committed the tree, without specifying parent commits...</p>

<pre><code>$ echo ""Imported project foo"" | git commit-tree $TREE
</code></pre>

<p>(<code>git-commit-tree</code> told us the sha1sum of the created commit object.)</p>

<p>... and created a new branch that points to our newly created
commit.</p>

<pre><code>$ git update-ref refs/heads/other-branch $COMMIT
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, we returned to the <code>master</code> branch to continue work there.</p>

<pre><code>$ git checkout -f master
</code></pre>

<p>This seems to have worked as planned. But this is clearly not the kind
of procedure I would recommend to someone who is just getting started
using git, to put it mildly. <strong>Is there an easier way of creating a
new branch that is entirely unrelated to everything that has happened
in the repository so far?</strong></p>

<li><p>The analyst downloads some data, munges the data and saves the result (e.g. adding a column for population per unit, or subsetting the data based on district boundaries).</p></li>
<li><p>The analyst analyzes the data created in (2), gets close to her goal, but sees that needs more data and so goes back to (1).</p></li>

<li><p>Write report incorporating tables and graphics.</p></li>
<li><p>Next year, the happy client comes back and wants an update.  This should be as simple as updating the upstream data by a new download (e.g. get the building permits from the last year), and pressing a ""RECALCULATE"" button, unless specifications change.</p></li>

<p>PS:</p>

<p>Below is a basic Makefile that checks for dependencies on various intermediate datasets (w/ <code>.RData</code> suffix) and scripts (<code>.R</code> suffix).  Make uses timestamps to check dependencies, so if you <code>touch ss07por.csv</code>, it will see that this file is newer than all the files / targets that depend on it, and execute the given scripts in order to update them accordingly.  This is still a work in progress, including a step for putting into SQL database, and a step for a templating language like sweave. Note that Make relies on tabs in its syntax, so read the manual before cutting and pasting. Enjoy and give feedback!</p>

"1456785","<p>I would like to gather as much information as possible regarding API versioning in .NET/CLR, and specifically how API changes do or do not break client applications. First, let's define some terms:</p>

<p><strong>API change</strong> - a change in the publicly visible definition of a type, including any of its public members. This includes changing type and member names, changing base type of a type, adding/removing interfaces from list of implemented interfaces of a type, adding/removing members (including overloads), changing member visibility, renaming method and type parameters, adding default values for method parameters, adding/removing attributes on types and members, and adding/removing generic type parameters on types and members (did I miss anything?). This does not include any changes in member bodies, or any changes to private members (i.e. we do not take into account Reflection).</p>

<p><strong>Binary-level break</strong> - an API change that results in client assemblies compiled against older version of the API potentially not loading with the new version. Example: changing method signature, even if it allows to be called in the same way as before (ie: void to return type / parameter default values overloads).</p>

<p><strong>Source-level break</strong> - an API change that results in existing code written to compile against older version of the API potentially not compiling with the new version. Already compiled client assemblies work as before, however. Example: adding a new overload that can result in ambiguity in method calls that were unambiguous previous.</p>

<p><strong>Source-level quiet semantics change</strong> - an API change that results in existing code written to compile against older version of the API quietly change its semantics, e.g. by calling a different method. The code should however continue to compile with no warnings/errors, and previously compiled assemblies should work as before. Example: implementing a new interface on an existing class that results in a different overload being chosen during overload resolution.</p>

<p>The ultimate goal is to catalogize as many breaking and quiet semantics API changes as possible, and describe exact effect of breakage, and which languages are and are not affected by it. To expand on the latter: while some changes affect all languages universally (e.g. adding a new member to an interface will break implementations of that interface in any language), some require very specific language semantics to enter into play to get a break. This most typically involves method overloading, and, in general, anything having to do with implicit type conversions. There doesn't seem to be any way to define the ""least common denominator"" here even for CLS-conformant languages (i.e. those conforming at least to rules of ""CLS consumer"" as defined in CLI spec) - though I'll appreciate if someone corrects me as being wrong here - so this will have to go language by language. Those of most interest are naturally the ones that come with .NET out of the box: C#, VB and F#; but others, such as IronPython, IronRuby, Delphi Prism etc are also relevant. The more of a corner case it is, the more interesting it will be - things like removing members are pretty self-evident, but subtle interactions between e.g. method overloading, optional/default parameters, lambda type inference, and conversion operators can be very surprising at times.</p>

<p>A few examples to kickstart this:</p>

<h2>Adding new method overloads</h2>

<p>Kind: source-level break</p>

<p>Languages affected: C#, VB, F#</p>

<p>API before change:</p>

<pre><code>public class Foo
{
    public void Bar(IEnumerable x);
}
</code></pre>

<p>API after change:</p>

<pre><code>public class Foo
{
    public void Bar(IEnumerable x);
    public void Bar(ICloneable x);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Sample client code working before change and broken after it:</p>

<pre><code>new Foo().Bar(new int[0]);
</code></pre>

<h2>Adding new implicit conversion operator overloads</h2>

<p>Kind: source-level break.</p>

<p>Languages affected: C#, VB</p>

<p>Languages not affected: F#</p>

<p>API before change:</p>

<pre><code>public class Foo
{
    public static implicit operator int ();
}
</code></pre>

<p>API after change:</p>

<pre><code>public class Foo
{
    public static implicit operator int ();
    public static implicit operator float ();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Sample client code working before change and broken after it:</p>

<pre><code>void Bar(int x);
void Bar(float x);
Bar(new Foo());
</code></pre>

<p>Notes: F# is not broken, because it does not have any language level support for overloaded operators, neither explicit nor implicit - both have to be called directly as <code>op_Explicit</code> and <code>op_Implicit</code> methods.</p>

<h2>Adding new instance methods</h2>

<p>Kind: source-level quiet semantics change.</p>

<p>Languages affected: C#, VB</p>

<p>Languages not affected: F#</p>

<p>API before change:</p>

<pre><code>public class Foo
{
}
</code></pre>

<p>API after change:</p>

<pre><code>public class Foo
{
    public void Bar();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Sample client code that suffers a quiet semantics change:</p>

<pre><code>public static class FooExtensions
{
    public void Bar(this Foo foo);
}

new Foo().Bar();
</code></pre>

<p>Notes: F# is not broken, because it does not have language level support for <code>ExtensionMethodAttribute</code>, and requires CLS extension methods to be called as static methods. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Should we use SET NOCOUNT ON for SQL Server? If not, why not?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>What it does</strong> Edit 6, on 22 Jul 2011</p>

<p>It suppresses the ""xx rows affected"" message after any DML. This is a resultset and when sent, the client must process it. It's tiny, but measurable (see answers below)</p>

<p>For triggers etc, the client will receive multiple ""xx rows affected"" and this causes all manner of errors for some ORMs, MS Access, JPA etc (see edits below)</p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>

<p>General accepted best practice (I thought until this question) is to use <code>SET NOCOUNT ON</code> in triggers and stored procedures in SQL Server. We use it everywhere and a quick google shows plenty of SQL Server MVPs agreeing too.</p>

<p>MSDN says this can break a <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.data.sqlclient.sqldataadapter.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">.net SQLDataAdapter</a>.</p>

<p>Now, this means to me that the SQLDataAdapter is limited to utterly simply CRUD processing because it expects the ""n rows affected"" message to match. So, I can't use:</p>

<ul>
<li>IF EXISTS to avoid duplicates (no rows affected message) <em>Note: use with caution</em></li>
<li>WHERE NOT EXISTS (less rows then expected</li>
<li>Filter out trivial updates (eg no data actually changes)</li>
<li>Do any table access before (such as logging)</li>
<li>Hide complexity or denormlisation</li>
<li>etc</li>
</ul>

<p>In the question marc_s (who knows his SQL stuff) says do not use it. This differs to what I think (and I regard myself as somewhat competent at SQL too).</p>

<p>Edit: More thoughts...</p>

<p>We have multiple clients: one may use a C# SQLDataAdaptor, another may use nHibernate from Java. These can be affected in different ways with <code>SET NOCOUNT ON</code>.</p>

<p>If you regard stored procs as methods, then it's bad form (anti-pattern) to assume some internal processing works a certain way for your own purposes.</p>

The structure could be taken as -</p>

<p>The inorder traversal yields - 8, 4, 9, 2, 5, 1, 6, 3, 7</p>

<p>And the postorder traversal yields - 8, 9, 4, 5, 2, 6, 7, 3, 1</p>

<p>So for instance, if we want to find the common ancestor of nodes 8 and 5, then we make a list of all the nodes which are between 8 and 5 in the inorder tree traversal, which in this case happens to be [4, 9, 2]. Then we check which node in this list appears last in the postorder traversal, which is 2. Hence the common ancestor for 8 and 5 is 2.</p>

<p>The complexity for this algorithm, I believe is O(n) (O(n) for inorder/postorder traversals, the rest of the steps again being O(n) since they are nothing more than simple iterations in arrays). But there is a strong chance that this is wrong. :-)</p>

<p>But this is a very crude approach, and I'm not sure if it breaks down for some case. Is there any other (possibly more optimal) solution to this problem?</p>

// If this were just a TextView, we could do:

<ul>
<li>Bcrypt uses Blowfish</li>
<li>Blowfish is better than MD5</li>
<li>Q: but is Blowfish better than SHA512? </li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks.. </p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>I want to clarify that I understand the difference between hashing and encryption. What prompted me to ask the question this way is <a href=""https://www.nccgroup.trust/us/about-us/newsroom-and-events/blog/2007/july/enough-with-the-rainbow-tables-what-you-need-to-know-about-secure-password-schemes/"" rel=""noreferrer"">this article</a>, <strong>where the author refers to bcrypt as ""adaptive hashing""</strong></p>

<p>Since bcrypt is based on Blowfish, I was led to think that Blowfish is a hashing algorithm. If it's encryption as answers have pointed out, then seems to me like it shouldn't have a place in this article. What's worse is that he's concluding that bcrypt is the best. 
What's also confusing me now is that the phpass class (used for password hashing I believe) uses bcrypt (i.e. blowfish, i.e. encryption). Based on this new info you guys are telling me (blowfish is encryption), this class sounds wrong. Am I missing something? </p>

"1565164","<p>Why do comparisons of NaN values behave differently from all other values?
That is, all comparisons with the operators ==, &lt;=, >=, &lt;, > where one or both values is NaN returns false, contrary to the behaviour of all other values.</p>

<p>I suppose this simplifies numerical computations in some way, but I couldn't find an explicitly stated reason, not even in the <a href=""http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~wkahan/ieee754status/IEEE754.PDF"">Lecture Notes on the Status of IEEE 754</a> by Kahan which discusses other design decisions in detail.</p>

<p>This deviant behavior is causing trouble when doing simple data processing. For example, when sorting a list of records w.r.t. some real-valued field in a C program I need to write extra code to handle NaN as the maximal element, otherwise the sort algorithm could become confused.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong>
The answers so far all argue that it is meaningless to compare NaNs.</p>

<p>I agree, but that doesn't mean that the correct answer is false,
rather it would be a Not-a-Boolean (NaB), which fortunately doesn't exist.</p>

<p>So the choice of returning true or false for comparisons is in my view arbitrary,
and for general data processing it would be advantageous if it obeyed the usual laws
(reflexivity of ==, trichotomy of &lt;, ==, >),
lest data structures which rely on these laws become confused.</p>

<p>So I'm asking for some concrete advantage of breaking these laws, not just philosophical reasoning.</p>

<p><strong>Edit 2:</strong>
I think I understand now why making NaN maximal would be a bad idea, it would mess up the computation of upper limits.</p>

<p>NaN != NaN might be desirable to avoid detecting convergence in a loop such as</p>

<pre><code>while (x != oldX) {
    oldX = x;
    x = better_approximation(x);
}
</code></pre>

<p>which however should better be written by comparing the absolute difference with a small limit.
So IMHO this is a relatively weak argument for breaking reflexivity at NaN.</p>

"1566595","<p>A project I'm working on requires the use of jQuery on customers' Web pages. Customers will insert a chunk of code that we'll supply which includes a few <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> elements that build a widget in a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code>-created <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code>. If they aren't already using the latest version of jQuery, this will also include (most likely) a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> for Google's hosted version of jQuery.</p>

<p>The problem is that some customers may already have an older version of jQuery installed. While this may work if it's at least a fairly recent version, our code does rely on some recently introduced functionality in the jQuery library, so there are bound to be instances when a customer's jQuery version is just too old. We can't require that they upgrade to the latest version of jQuery.</p>

<p>Is there any way to load a newer version of jQuery to use only within the context of our code, that will not interfere with, or affect, any code on the customer's page? Ideally, maybe we could check for the presence of jQuery, detect the version, and if it's too old, then somehow load the most recent version just to use for our code.</p>

<p>I had the idea of loading jQuery in an <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> in the customer's domain that also includes our <code>&lt;script&gt;</code>, which seems like it might be feasible, but I'm hoping there's a more elegant way to do it (not to mention without the performance and complexity penalties of extra <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code>s).</p>

"1605332","<p>I am trying to figure out if there is any difference in performance (or advantages) when we use nio <code>FileChannel</code> versus normal <code>FileInputStream/FileOuputStream</code> to read and write files to filesystem. I observed that on my machine both perform at the same level, also many times the <code>FileChannel</code> way is slower. Can I please know more details comparing these two methods. Here is the code I used, the file that I am testing with is around <code>350MB</code>.

<p>From the responses here, it became clear that there's no built-in way to call <code>.apply()</code> with the <code>new</code> operator. However, people suggested a number of really interesting solutions to the problem.</p>

<p>My preferred solution was <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1606797/use-of-apply-with-new-operator-is-this-possible/#1608546"">this one from Matthew Crumley</a> (I've modified it to pass the <code>arguments</code> property):</p>

<pre><code>var createSomething = (function() {
    function F(args) {

    F.prototype = Something.prototype;

<p>Here is <a href=""https://bitbucket.org/otac0n/battleship"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the framework, now hosted on Bitbucket</a>.</p>

<p><strong>The winner will be awarded +450 reputation!</strong> The competition will be held starting on the <strong>17th of November, 2009</strong>.  No entries or edits later than zero-hour on the 17th will be accepted.  (Central Standard Time)
Submit your entries early, so you don't miss your opportunity!</p>

<p><em>To keep this <strong>OBJECTIVE</strong>, please follow the spirit of the competition.</em></p>

<p><strong>Rules of the game:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>The game is be played on a 10x10 grid.</li>
<li>Each competitor will place each of 5 ships (of lengths 2, 3, 3, 4, 5) on their grid.</li>
<li>No ships may overlap, but they may be adjacent.</li>
<li>The competitors then take turns firing single shots at their opponent.

<ul>
<li>A variation on the game allows firing multiple shots per volley, one for each surviving ship.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The opponent will notify the competitor if the shot sinks, hits, or misses.</li>
<li>Game play ends when all of the ships of any one player are sunk.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Rules of the competition:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>The spirit of the competition is to find the best Battleship algorithm.</li>
<li>Anything that is deemed against the spirit of the competition will be grounds for disqualification.</li>
<li>Interfering with an opponent is against the spirit of the competition.</li>
<li>Multithreading may be used under the following restrictions:

<ul>
<li>No more than one thread may be running while it is not your turn. (Though, any number of threads may be in a ""Suspended"" state).</li>
<li>No thread may run at a priority other than ""Normal"".</li>
<li>Given the above two restrictions, you will be guaranteed at least 3 dedicated CPU cores during your turn.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A limit of 1 second of CPU time per game is allotted to each competitor on the primary thread.</li>
<li>Running out of time results in losing the current game.</li>
<li>Any unhandled exception will result in losing the current game.</li>
<li>Network access and disk access is allowed, but you may find the time restrictions fairly prohibitive.  However, a few set-up and tear-down methods have been added to alleviate the time strain.</li>
<li>Code should be posted on stack overflow as an answer, or, if too large, linked.</li>
<li>Max total size (un-compressed) of an entry is 1 MB.</li>
<li>Officially, .Net 2.0 / 3.5 is the only framework requirement.</li>
<li>Your entry must implement the IBattleshipOpponent interface.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Scoring:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Best 51 games out of 101 games is the winner of a match.</li>
<li>All competitors will play matched against each other, round-robin style.</li>
<li>The best half of the competitors will then play a double-elimination tournament to determine the winner.  (Smallest power of two that is greater than or equal to half, actually.)</li>
<li>I will be using the <a href=""https://github.com/otac0n/tournaments"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">TournamentApi</a> framework for the tournament.</li>
<li>The results will be posted here.</li>
<li>If you submit more than one entry, only your best-scoring entry is eligible for the double-elim.</li>
</ol>

<p>Good luck! Have fun!</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 1:</strong><br/>
Thanks to <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/users/190480/freed"">Freed</a>, who has found an error in the <code>Ship.IsValid</code> function.  It has been fixed.  Please download the updated version of the framework.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 2:</strong><br/>
Since there has been significant interest in persisting stats to disk and such, I have added a few non-timed set-up and tear-down events that should provide the required functionality.  This is a <strong>semi-breaking change</strong>.  That is to say: the interface has been modified to add functions, but no body is required for them.  Please download the updated version of the framework.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 3:</strong><br/>
Bug Fix 1: <code>GameWon</code> and <code>GameLost</code> were only getting called in the case of a time out.<br/>
Bug Fix 2: If an engine was timing out every game, the competition would never end.<br/>

<p>Can you explain the reasoning behind the syntax for encapsulated anonymous functions in JavaScript? Why does this work: <code>(function(){})();</code> but this doesn't: <code>function(){}();</code>?</p>

<hr>

<h2>What I know</h2>

<p>In JavaScript, one creates a named function like this:</p>

<pre><code>function twoPlusTwo(){
    alert(2 + 2);
}
twoPlusTwo();
</code></pre>

<p>You can also create an anonymous function and assign it to a variable:</p>

<pre><code>var twoPlusTwo = function(){
    alert(2 + 2);
};
twoPlusTwo();
</code></pre>

<p>You can encapsulate a block of code by creating an anonymous function, then wrapping it in brackets and executing it immediately:</p>

<pre><code>(function(){
    alert(2 + 2);
})();
</code></pre>

<p>This is useful when creating modularised scripts, to avoid cluttering up the current scope, or global scope, with potentially conflicting variables - as in the case of Greasemonkey scripts, jQuery plugins, etc.</p>

<p>Now, I understand why this works. The brackets enclose the contents and expose only the outcome (I'm sure there's a better way to describe that), such as with <code>(2 + 2) === 4</code>.</p>

<h2>Words of Warning (update)</h2>

<p><code>REMOTE_ADDR</code> still represents the <em>most reliable</em> source of an IP address. The other <code>$_SERVER</code> variables mentioned here can be spoofed by a remote client very easily. The purpose of this solution is to attempt to determine the IP address of a client sitting behind a proxy. For your general purposes, you might consider using this in combination with the IP address returned directly from <code>$_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']</code> and storing both.</p>

<p><strong>For 99.9% of users this solution will suit your needs perfectly.</strong> It will not protect you from the 0.1% of malicious users looking to abuse your system by injecting their own request headers. If relying on IP addresses for something mission critical, resort to <code>REMOTE_ADDR</code> and don't bother catering to those behind a proxy.</p>

<p>While reading about classes, it goes on to say that in Python there is no need to declare instance variables. You just use them in the constructor, and boom, they are there. </p>

<p>So for example:</p>

<pre><code>class Simple:
    def __init__(self, s):
        print(""inside the simple constructor"")
        self.s = s

    def show(self):
        print(self.s)

    def showMsg(self, msg):
        print(msg + ':', self.show())
</code></pre>

<p>If that’s true, then any object of class <code>Simple</code> can just change the value of variable <code>s</code> outside of the class. </p>

<p>For example: </p>

<pre><code>if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    x = Simple(""constructor argument"")
    x.s = ""test15"" # this changes the value
    x.show()
    x.showMsg(""A message"")
</code></pre>

<p>In Java, we have been taught about public/private/protected variables.  Those keywords make sense because at times you want variables in a class to which no one outside the class has access to. </p>

Is this a <code>JKS</code> file, or <code>PKCS#12</code>? What's supposed to be in them; just the client certificate, or a key? If so, which key? There's quite a bit of confusion about all the different kinds of files, certificate types and such.</p>

<p>As I've said before I'm new to <code>HTTPS/SSL/TLS</code> so I would appreciate some background information as well (doesn't have to be an essay; I'll settle for links to good articles).</p>

<li><a href=""http://davidhayden.com/blog/dave/archive/2005/12/09/2615.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://davidhayden.com/blog/dave/archive/2005/12/09/2615.aspx</a> (from 2005) talks about how escalation to DTC will always happen when connecting to SQL2000.  We're using SQL2005/2008</li>

</ul>

<p>That MSDN transaction-escalation page states that the following conditions will cause a transaction to escalate to DTC:</p>

<ol>
<li>At least one durable resource that does not support single-phase notifications is enlisted in the transaction.</li>
<li>At least two durable resources that support single-phase notifications are enlisted in the transaction. For example, enlisting a single connection with does not cause a transaction to be promoted. However, whenever you open a second connection to a database causing the database to enlist, the System.Transactions infrastructure detects that it is the second durable resource in the transaction, and escalates it to an MSDTC transaction.</li>
<li>A request to ""marshal"" the transaction to a different application domain or different process is invoked. For example, the serialization of the transaction object across an application domain boundary. The transaction object is marshaled-by-value, meaning that any attempt to pass it across an application domain boundary (even in the same process) results in serialization of the transaction object. You can pass the transaction objects by making a call on a remote method that takes a Transaction as a parameter or you can try to access a remote transactional-serviced component. This serializes the transaction object and results in an escalation, as when a transaction is serialized across an application domain. It is being distributed and the local transaction manager is no longer adequate.</li>
</ol>

<p>We're not experiencing #3. #2 is not happening because there is only ever one connection at a time, and it's also to a single 'durable resource'.  Is there any way that #1 could be happening?  Some SQL2005/8 configuration that causes it to not support single-phase notifications?</p>

<h1>Update 2:</h1>

<p>Re-investigated, personally, everyone's SQL Server versions - ""Dev 3"" actually has SQL2008, and ""Dev 4"" is actually SQL2005.  That'll teach me to never trust my coworkers again. ;)  Because of this change in data, I'm pretty sure we've found our problem.  Our SQL2008 developers weren't experiencing the problem because SQL2008 has copious amounts of awesome included that SQL2005 does not have.</p>

<p>It also tells me that because we're going to be supporting SQL2005 that we can't use TransactionScope like we have been, and if we want to use TransactionScope we're going to need to be passing a single SqlConnection object around...which seems problematic in situations where the SqlConnection can't easily be passed around...it just smells of global-SqlConnection instance.  Pew!</p>

<h1>Update 3</h1>

<p>Just to clarify up here in the question:</p>

<p>SQL2008:</p>

<ul>
<li>Allows multiple connections within a single TransactionScope (as demonstrated in the above sample code.)</li>
<li>Caveat #1: If those multiple SqlConnections are nested, that is, two or more SqlConnections are opened at the same time, TransactionScope will immediately escalate to DTC.  </li>
<li>Caveat #2: If an additional SqlConnection is opened to a different <em>'durable resource'</em> (ie: a different SQL Server,) it will immediately escalate to DTC</li>
</ul>

<p>SQL2005:</p>

<ul>
<li>Does not allow multiple connections within a single TransactionScope, period.  It will escalate when/if a second SqlConnection is opened.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Update 4</h1>

<p>In the interest of making this question even more <strike>of a mess</strike> useful, and just for more clarity's sake, here's how you can get SQL2005 to escalate to DTC with a <em>single</em> <code>SqlConnection</code>:</p>

<pre><code>using (TransactionScope transactionScope = new TransactionScope()) {
   using (SqlConnection connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString)) {
      connection.Open();
      connection.Close();
      connection.Open(); // escalates to DTC
   }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This just seems broken to me, but I guess I can understand if every call to <code>SqlConnection.Open()</code> is grabbing from the connection pool.  </p>

<p><em>""Why might this happen, though?""</em>  Well, if you use a SqlTableAdapter against that connection before it's opened, the SqlTableAdapter will open and close the connection, effectively finishing the transaction for you because you now can't re-open it.</p>

<p>So, basically, in order to successfully use TransactionScope with SQL2005 you need to have some sort of global connection object that remains open from the point of the first TransactionScope is instantiated until it's no longer needed.  Besides the code-smell of a global connection object, opening the connection first and closing it last is at odds against the logic of opening a connection as late as possible and closing it as soon as possible.  </p>

It always selects the whole list item and from there goes directly to the next list item ignoring the buttons, even though I set <code>.setFocusable(true)</code> and <code>setClickable(true)</code> for the buttons in <code>getView()</code>.</p>

<p>I also added this code to my custom list adapter:</p>

<pre><code>@Override
public boolean  areAllItemsEnabled() {
    return false;           
}

@Override
public boolean isEnabled(int position) {
        return false;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This causes that no list item is selectable at all any more. But it didn't help in making the nested buttons selectable.</p>

<p>Anyone an idea?</p>

"1711631","<p>Optimizing SQLite is tricky. Bulk-insert performance of a C application can vary from 85 inserts per second to over 96,000 inserts per second!</p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong> We are using SQLite as part of a desktop application. We have large amounts of configuration data stored in XML files that are parsed and loaded into an SQLite database for further processing when the application is initialized. SQLite is ideal for this situation because it's fast, it requires no specialized configuration, and the database is stored on disk as a single file.</p>

<p><strong>Rationale:</strong> <em>Initially I was disappointed with the performance I was seeing.</em> It turns-out that the performance of SQLite can vary significantly (both for bulk-inserts and selects) depending on how the database is configured and how you're using the API. It was not a trivial matter to figure out what all of the options and techniques were, so I thought it prudent to create this community wiki entry to share the results with Stack&nbsp;Overflow readers in order to save others the trouble of the same investigations.</p>

<p><strong>The Experiment:</strong> Rather than simply talking about performance tips in the general sense (i.e. <em>""Use a transaction!""</em>), I thought it best to write some C code and <em>actually measure</em> the impact of various options. We're going to start with some simple data:</p>

<ul>
<li>A 28 MB TAB-delimited text file (approximately 865,000 records) of the <a href=""http://www.toronto.ca/open/datasets/ttc-routes"" rel=""noreferrer"">complete transit schedule for the city of Toronto</a></li>
<li>My test machine is a 3.60 GHz P4 running Windows XP.</li>
<li>The code is compiled with <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_C%2B%2B#32-bit_versions"" rel=""noreferrer"">Visual C++</a> 2005 as ""Release"" with ""Full Optimization"" (/Ox) and Favor Fast Code (/Ot).</li>
<li>I'm using the SQLite ""Amalgamation"", compiled directly into my test application. The SQLite version I happen to have is a bit older (3.6.7), but I suspect these results will be comparable to the latest release (please leave a comment if you think otherwise).</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Let's write some code!</em></p>

<p><strong>The Code:</strong> A simple C program that reads the text file line-by-line, splits the string into values and then inserts the data into an SQLite database. In this ""baseline"" version of the code, the database is created, but we won't actually insert data:</p>

<h2>The ""Control""</h2>

<p>Running the code as-is doesn't actually perform any database operations, but it will give us an idea of how fast the raw C file I/O and string processing operations are.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Imported 864913 records in 0.94
  seconds</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Great! We can do 920,000 inserts per second, provided we don't actually do any inserts :-)</p>

<hr>

<h2>The ""Worst-Case-Scenario""</h2>

<p>We're going to generate the SQL string using the values read from the file and invoke that SQL operation using sqlite3_exec:</p>

<pre><code>sprintf(sSQL, ""INSERT INTO TTC VALUES (NULL, '%s', '%s', '%s', '%s', '%s', '%s', '%s')"", sRT, sBR, sVR, sST, sVI, sDT, sTM);
sqlite3_exec(db, sSQL, NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);
</code></pre>

<p>This is going to be slow because the SQL will be compiled into VDBE code for every insert and every insert will happen in its own transaction. <em>How slow?</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Imported 864913 records in 9933.61
  seconds</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yikes! 2 hours and 45 minutes! That's only <strong>85 inserts per second.</strong></p>

<h2>Using a Transaction</h2>

<p>By default, SQLite will evaluate every INSERT / UPDATE statement within a unique transaction. If performing a large number of inserts, it's advisable to wrap your operation in a transaction:</p>

<pre><code>sqlite3_exec(db, ""BEGIN TRANSACTION"", NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);

pFile = fopen (INPUTDATA,""r"");
while (!feof(pFile)) {

    ...

}
fclose (pFile);

sqlite3_exec(db, ""END TRANSACTION"", NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>Imported 864913 records in 38.03
  seconds</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That's better. Simply wrapping all of our inserts in a single transaction improved our performance to <strong>23,000 inserts per second.</strong></p>

<h2>Using a Prepared Statement</h2>

<p>Using a transaction was a huge improvement, but recompiling the SQL statement for every insert doesn't make sense if we using the same SQL over-and-over. Let's use <code>sqlite3_prepare_v2</code> to compile our SQL statement once and then bind our parameters to that statement using <code>sqlite3_bind_text</code>:</p>

<pre><code>/* Open input file and import into the database */
cStartClock = clock();

sprintf(sSQL, ""INSERT INTO TTC VALUES (NULL, @RT, @BR, @VR, @ST, @VI, @DT, @TM)"");
sqlite3_prepare_v2(db,  sSQL, BUFFER_SIZE, &amp;stmt, &amp;tail);

sqlite3_exec(db, ""BEGIN TRANSACTION"", NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);

pFile = fopen (INPUTDATA,""r"");
while (!feof(pFile)) {

    fgets (sInputBuf, BUFFER_SIZE, pFile);

    sRT = strtok (sInputBuf, ""\t"");   /* Get Route */
    sBR = strtok (NULL, ""\t"");        /* Get Branch */
    sVR = strtok (NULL, ""\t"");        /* Get Version */
    sST = strtok (NULL, ""\t"");        /* Get Stop Number */
    sVI = strtok (NULL, ""\t"");        /* Get Vehicle */
    sDT = strtok (NULL, ""\t"");        /* Get Date */
    sTM = strtok (NULL, ""\t"");        /* Get Time */

    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 1, sRT, -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);
    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 2, sBR, -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);
    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 3, sVR, -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);
    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 4, sST, -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);
    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 5, sVI, -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);
    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 6, sDT, -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);
    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 7, sTM, -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);

    sqlite3_step(stmt);

    sqlite3_clear_bindings(stmt);
    sqlite3_reset(stmt);

    n++;
}
fclose (pFile);

sqlite3_exec(db, ""END TRANSACTION"", NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);

printf(""Imported %d records in %4.2f seconds\n"", n, (clock() - cStartClock) / (double)CLOCKS_PER_SEC);

sqlite3_finalize(stmt);
sqlite3_close(db);

return 0;
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>Imported 864913 records in 16.27
  seconds</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nice! There's a little bit more code (don't forget to call <code>sqlite3_clear_bindings</code> and <code>sqlite3_reset</code>), but we've more than doubled our performance to <strong>53,000 inserts per second.</strong></p>

<h2>PRAGMA synchronous = OFF</h2>

<p>By default, SQLite will pause after issuing a OS-level write command. This guarantees that the data is written to the disk. By setting <code>synchronous = OFF</code>, we are instructing SQLite to simply hand-off the data to the OS for writing and then continue. There's a chance that the database file may become corrupted if the computer suffers a catastrophic crash (or power failure) before the data is written to the platter:</p>

<pre><code>/* Open the database and create the schema */
sqlite3_open(DATABASE, &amp;db);
sqlite3_exec(db, TABLE, NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);
sqlite3_exec(db, ""PRAGMA synchronous = OFF"", NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>Imported 864913 records in 12.41
  seconds</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The improvements are now smaller, but we're up to <strong>69,600 inserts per second.</strong></p>

<h2>PRAGMA journal_mode = MEMORY</h2>

<p>Consider storing the rollback journal in memory by evaluating <code>PRAGMA journal_mode = MEMORY</code>. Your transaction will be faster, but if you lose power or your program crashes during a transaction you database could be left in a corrupt state with a partially-completed transaction:</p>

<pre><code>/* Open the database and create the schema */
sqlite3_open(DATABASE, &amp;db);
sqlite3_exec(db, TABLE, NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);
sqlite3_exec(db, ""PRAGMA journal_mode = MEMORY"", NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>Imported 864913 records in 13.50
  seconds</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A little slower than the previous optimization at <strong>64,000 inserts per second.</strong></p>

<h2>PRAGMA synchronous = OFF <em>and</em> PRAGMA journal_mode = MEMORY</h2>

<p>Let's combine the previous two optimizations. It's a little more risky (in case of a crash), but we're just importing data (not running a bank):</p>

<pre><code>/* Open the database and create the schema */
sqlite3_open(DATABASE, &amp;db);
sqlite3_exec(db, TABLE, NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);
sqlite3_exec(db, ""PRAGMA synchronous = OFF"", NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);
sqlite3_exec(db, ""PRAGMA journal_mode = MEMORY"", NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>Imported 864913 records in 12.00
  seconds</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fantastic! We're able to do <strong>72,000 inserts per second.</strong></p>

<h2>Using an In-Memory Database</h2>

<p>Just for kicks, let's build upon all of the previous optimizations and redefine the database filename so we're working entirely in RAM:</p>

<pre><code>#define DATABASE "":memory:""
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>Imported 864913 records in 10.94
  seconds</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's not super-practical to store our database in RAM, but it's impressive that we can perform <strong>79,000 inserts per second.</strong></p>

<h2>Refactoring C Code</h2>

<p>Although not specifically an SQLite improvement, I don't like the extra <code>char*</code> assignment operations in the <code>while</code> loop. Let's quickly refactor that code to pass the output of <code>strtok()</code> directly into <code>sqlite3_bind_text()</code>, and let the compiler try to speed things up for us:</p>

<pre><code>pFile = fopen (INPUTDATA,""r"");
while (!feof(pFile)) {

    fgets (sInputBuf, BUFFER_SIZE, pFile);

    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 1, strtok (sInputBuf, ""\t""), -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT); /* Get Route */
    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 2, strtok (NULL, ""\t""), -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);    /* Get Branch */
    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 3, strtok (NULL, ""\t""), -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);    /* Get Version */
    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 4, strtok (NULL, ""\t""), -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);    /* Get Stop Number */
    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 5, strtok (NULL, ""\t""), -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);    /* Get Vehicle */
    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 6, strtok (NULL, ""\t""), -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);    /* Get Date */
    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 7, strtok (NULL, ""\t""), -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);    /* Get Time */

    sqlite3_step(stmt);        /* Execute the SQL Statement */
    sqlite3_clear_bindings(stmt);    /* Clear bindings */
    sqlite3_reset(stmt);        /* Reset VDBE */

    n++;
}
fclose (pFile);
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Note: We are back to using a real database file. In-memory databases are fast, but not necessarily practical</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Imported 864913 records in 8.94
  seconds</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A slight refactoring to the string processing code used in our parameter binding has allowed us to perform <strong>96,700 inserts per second.</strong> I think it's safe to say that this is <em>plenty fast</em>. As we start to tweak other variables (i.e. page size, index creation, etc.) this will be our benchmark.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Summary (so far)</h2>

<p><em>I hope you're still with me!</em> The reason we started down this road is that bulk-insert performance varies so wildly with SQLite, and it's not always obvious what changes need to be made to speed-up our operation. Using the same compiler (and compiler options), the same version of SQLite and the same data we've optimized our code and our usage of SQLite to go <strong>from a worst-case scenario of 85 inserts per second to over 96,000 inserts per second!</strong></p>

<hr>

<h2>CREATE INDEX then INSERT vs. INSERT then CREATE INDEX</h2>

<p>Before we start measuring <code>SELECT</code> performance, we know that we'll be creating indices. It's been suggested in one of the answers below that when doing bulk inserts, it is faster to create the index after the data has been inserted (as opposed to creating the index first then inserting the data). Let's try:</p>

<p><strong>Create Index then Insert Data</strong></p>

<pre><code>sqlite3_exec(db, ""CREATE  INDEX 'TTC_Stop_Index' ON 'TTC' ('Stop')"", NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);
sqlite3_exec(db, ""BEGIN TRANSACTION"", NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);
...
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>Imported 864913 records in 18.13
  seconds</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Insert Data then Create Index</strong></p>

<pre><code>...
sqlite3_exec(db, ""END TRANSACTION"", NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);
sqlite3_exec(db, ""CREATE  INDEX 'TTC_Stop_Index' ON 'TTC' ('Stop')"", NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>Imported 864913 records in 13.66
  seconds</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As expected, bulk-inserts are slower if one column is indexed, but it does make a difference if the index is created after the data is inserted. Our no-index baseline is 96,000 inserts per second. <strong>Creating the index first then inserting data gives us 47,700 inserts per second, whereas inserting the data first then creating the index gives us 63,300 inserts per second.</strong></p>

<hr>

<p>I'd gladly take suggestions for other scenarios to try... And will be compiling similar data for SELECT queries soon.</p>

"1718037","<p>I am looking at the <a href=""http://www.codeplex.com/MVCContrib"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">MvcContrib</a> Grid component and I'm fascinated, yet at the same time repulsed, by a syntactic trick used in the <a href=""http://www.jeremyskinner.co.uk/2009/02/22/rewriting-the-mvccontrib-grid-part-2-new-syntax/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Grid syntax</a>:</p>

<pre><code>.Attributes(style =&gt; ""width:100%"")
</code></pre>

<p>The syntax above sets the style attribute of the generated HTML to <code>width:100%</code>. Now if you pay attention, 'style' is nowhere specified. It is deduced from the <strong>name</strong> of the parameter in the expression! I had to dig into this and found where the 'magic' happens:</p>

<pre><code>Hash(params Func&lt;object, TValue&gt;[] hash)
{
    foreach (var func in hash)
    {
        Add(func.Method.GetParameters()[0].Name, func(null));
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>So indeed, the code is using the formal, compile time, name of parameters to create the dictionary of attribute name-value pairs. The resulted syntax construct is very expressive indeed, but at the same time very dangerous.</p>

<p>The general use of lambda expressions allows for replacement of the <em>names</em> used without side effect. I see an example in a book that says <code>collection.ForEach(book =&gt; Fire.Burn(book))</code> I know I can write in my code <code>collection.ForEach(log =&gt; Fire.Burn(log))</code> and <em>it means the same thing</em>. But with the MvcContrib Grid syntax here all of a sudden, I find code that actively looks and makes decisions based on the names I choose for my variables!</p>

<p>So is this common practice with the C# 3.5/4.0 community and the lambda expressions lovers? Or is a rogue one trick maverick I shouldn't worry about?</p>

<p>...would work in either versions. <strong>The library is eminently useable</strong>: in fact it's fantastic. However, those previously unfamiliar with Scala and <em>poking around to get a feel for the language</em> now have to make sense of method signatures like:</p>

<pre><code>def map[B, That](f: A =&gt; B)(implicit bf: CanBuildFrom[Repr, B, That]): That
</code></pre>

<p>For such simple functionality, this is a daunting signature and one which I find myself struggling to understand. <strong>Not that I think Scala was ever likely to be the next Java</strong> (or /C/C++/C#) - I don't believe its creators were aiming it at that market - but I think it is/was certainly feasible for Scala to become the next Ruby or Python (i.e. to gain a significant commercial user-base)</p>

The survey contains different types of questions.

<p>I've come up with two possible solutions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Create a giant table which contains
the answers for each survey
submission. Each column would
correspond to an answer from the
survey. i.e. SurveyID, Answer1,
Answer2, Answer3</p>

<p>I don't think this is the best way
since there are a lot of questions
in this survey and doesn't seem very
flexible if the survey is to change.</p></li>
<li><p>The other thing I thought of was
creating a Question table and Answer
table. The question table would
contain all the questions for the
survey. The answer table would contain
individual answers from the survey,
each row linked to a question.</p>

<p>A simple example:</p>

<p><strong>tblSurvey</strong>: SurveyID</p>

<p><strong>tblQuestion</strong>: QuestionID, <em>SurveyID</em>, QuestionType, Question  </p>

<p><strong>tblAnswer</strong>: AnswerID, <em>UserID</em>, <em>QuestionID</em>, Answer</p>

<p><strong>tblUser</strong>: UserID, UserName</p>

<p>My problem with this is that there
could be tons of answers which would
make the Answer table pretty huge.

comes to performance.</p></li>

<p>A sample page is like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;html&gt;
 &lt;head&gt;
  &lt;script src=""jquery.js"" type=""text/javascript""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;script src=""abc.js"" type=""text/javascript""&gt;
  &lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;link rel=""stylesheets"" type=""text/css"" href=""abc.css""&gt;&lt;/link&gt;
  &lt;style&gt;h2{font-wight:bold;}&lt;/style&gt;
  &lt;script&gt;
  $(document).ready(function(){
     $(""#img"").attr(""src"", ""kkk.png"");
  });
 &lt;/script&gt;
 &lt;/head&gt;
 &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;img id=""img"" src=""abc.jpg"" style=""width:400px;height:300px;""/&gt;
    &lt;script src=""kkk.js"" type=""text/javascript""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
 &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So here are my questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>How does this page load?</li>
<li>What is the sequence of the loading?</li>
<li>When is the JS code executed? (inline and external)</li>
<li>When is the CSS executed (applied)?</li>
<li>When does $(document).ready get executed?</li>
<li>Will abc.jpg be downloaded? Or does it just download kkk.png?</li>
</ol>

<p>I have the following understanding:</p>

<ol>
<li>The browser loads the html (DOM) at first.</li>
<li>The browser starts to load the external resources from top to bottom, line by line.</li>
<li>If a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> is met, the loading will be blocked and wait until the JS file is loaded and executed and then continue.</li>
<li>Other resources (CSS/images) are loaded in parallel and executed if needed (like CSS).</li>
</ol>

<p>Or is it like this:</p>

<p>The browser parses the html (DOM) and gets the external resources in an array or stack-like structure. After the html is loaded, the browser starts to load the external resources in the structure in parallel and execute, until all resources are loaded. Then the DOM will be changed corresponding to the user's behaviors depending on the JS.</p>

<p>Can anyone give a detailed explanation about what happens when you've got the response of a html page? Does this vary in different browsers? Any reference about this question?</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<li>a navigation bar class that shows buttons</li>
<li>a logging object</li>
<li>possibly, custom error handling</li>
</ul>

<p>etc.</p>

<p>I am dealing with the eternal question, how to best make these objects accessible to each part of the system that needs it.</p>

<p>my first apporach, many years ago was to have a $application global that contained initialized instances of these classes.</p>

<pre><code>global $application;
$application-&gt;messageHandler-&gt;addMessage(""Item successfully inserted"");
</code></pre>

<p>I then changed over to the Singleton pattern and a factory function:</p>

<pre><code>$mh =&amp;factory(""messageHandler"");
$mh-&gt;addMessage(""Item successfully inserted"");
</code></pre>

<p>but I'm not happy with that either. Unit tests and encapsulation become more and more important to me, and in my understanding the logic behind globals/singletons destroys the basic idea of OOP.</p>

<p>Then there is of course the possibility of giving each object a number of pointers to the helper objects it needs, probably the very cleanest, resource-saving and testing-friendly way but I have doubts about the maintainability of this in the long run. </p>

<p>Most PHP frameworks I have looked into use either the singleton pattern, or functions that access the initialized objects. Both fine approaches, but as I said I'm happy with neither. </p>

<p>I would like to broaden my horizon on what common patterns exist here. I am looking for examples, additional ideas and pointers towards resources that discuss this from a <strong>long-term</strong>, <strong>real-world</strong> perspective. </p>

<p>Also, I'm interested to hear about specialized, niche or <strong>plain weird</strong> approaches to the issue.</p>

"1820908","<p>I've got some Java code with SQL statements written as Java strings (please no OR/M flamewars, the embedded SQL is what it is - not my decision).</p>

<p>I've broken the SQL statements semantically into several concatenated strings over several lines of code for ease of maintenance. So instead of something like:</p>

<pre><code>String query = ""SELECT FOO, BAR, BAZ FROM ABC WHERE BAR &gt; 4"";
</code></pre>

<p>I have something like:</p>

<pre><code>String query =
    ""SELECT FOO, BAR, BAZ"" +
    ""  FROM ABC          "" +
    "" WHERE BAR &gt; 4      "";
</code></pre>

<p>This style makes the SQL much easier to read and maintain (IMHO), especially for larger queries. For example, I can put my editor into ""overwrite"" mode and modify the text in-place fairly easily.</p>

<p><strong>Note that this issue generalizes beyond the particular example of SQL. Any code that is written with any vertical formatting, particularly tabular constructs, is susceptible to destruction by a pretty printer.</strong></p>

<p>Now, some project members use the Eclipse editor and the semantic formatting is often destroyed when they format an entire source file.</p>

<p><strong>Is there a way to instruct Eclipse to ignore certain lines of source with respect to formatting?</strong></p>

<p>I'm looking for something like a special comment that toggles the Eclipse formatter. Ideally, such a comment could be configurable to be whatever we choose, and other formatters could be programmed to respect it as well:</p>

<pre><code>// STOP-ECLIPSE-FORMATTING
String query =
    ""SELECT FOO, BAR, BAZ"" +
    ""  FROM ABC          "" +
    "" WHERE BAR &gt; 4      "";
// START-ECLIPSE-FORMATTING
</code></pre>

<p>Ideally, a solution will allow me to insert instructions for the Eclipse formatter <strong>without requiring team members using Eclipse to do any IDE reconfiguration</strong> (other than possibly choosing a formatter agnostic command comment: <code>STOP-ECLIPSE-FORMATTING</code> &rarr; <code>STOP-FORMATTING</code>).</p>

"1824418","<p>A (long) while ago I wrote a web-spider that I multithreaded to enable concurrent requests to occur at the same time.  That was in my Python youth, in the days before I knew about the <a href=""http://www.dabeaz.com/python/GIL.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">GIL</a> and the associated woes it creates for multithreaded code (IE, most of the time stuff just ends up serialized!)...</p>

<p>I'd like to rework this code to make it more robust and perform better.  There are basically two ways I could do this: I could use the new <a href=""http://docs.python.org/library/multiprocessing.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">multiprocessing module</a> in 2.6+ or I could go for a reactor / event-based model of some sort.  I would rather do the later since it's far simpler and less error-prone.</p>

<p>So the question relates to what framework would be best suited to my needs.  The following is a list of the options I know about so far:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Twisted</a>: The granddaddy of Python reactor frameworks: seems complex and a bit bloated however.  Steep learning curve for a small task.</li>
<li><a href=""http://eventlet.net/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Eventlet</a>: From the guys at <a href=""http://lindenlab.com/"" rel=""noreferrer"">lindenlab</a>.  Greenlet based framework that's geared towards these kinds of tasks. I had a look at the code though and it's not too pretty: non-pep8 compliant, scattered with prints (why do people do this in a framework!?), API seems a little inconsistent.</li>
<li><a href=""http://code.google.com/p/pyev/"" rel=""noreferrer"">PyEv</a>: Immature, doesn't seem to be anyone using it right now though it is based on libevent so it's got a solid backend.</li>
<li><a href=""http://docs.python.org/library/asyncore.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">asyncore</a>: From the stdlib: über low-level, seems like a lot of legwork involved just to get something off the ground.</li>
<li><a href=""http://www.tornadoweb.org/"" rel=""noreferrer"">tornado</a>: Though this is a server oriented product designed to server dynamic websites it does feature an <a href=""http://github.com/facebook/tornado/blob/master/tornado/httpclient.py"" rel=""noreferrer"">async HTTP client</a> and a simple <a href=""http://github.com/facebook/tornado/blob/master/tornado/ioloop.py"" rel=""noreferrer"">ioloop</a>.  Looks like it could get the job done but not what it was intended for. 
[edit: doesn't run on Windows unfortunately, which counts it out for me - its a requirement for me to support this lame platform]</li>
</ul>

<p>Is there anything I have missed at all?  Surely there must be a library out there that fits the sweet-spot of a simplified async networking library!</p>

<p>[edit: big thanks to <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/users/177663/intgr"">intgr</a> for his pointer to <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/cogen/"" rel=""noreferrer"">this page</a>.  If you scroll to the bottom you will see there is a really nice list of projects that aim to tackle this task in one way or another.  It seems actually that things have indeed moved on since the inception of Twisted: people now seem to favour a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coroutine"" rel=""noreferrer"">co-routine</a> based solution rather than a traditional reactor / callback oriented one.  The benefits of this approach are clearer more direct code: I've certainly found in the past, especially when working with <a href=""http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_41_0/doc/html/boost_asio.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">boost.asio</a> in C++ that callback based code can lead to designs that can be hard-to-follow and are relatively obscure to the untrained eye.  Using co-routines allows you to write code that looks a little more synchronous at least.  I guess now my task is to work out which one of these many libraries I like the look of and give it a go!

"1853243","<p>Exception handling (EH) seems to be the current standard, and by searching the web, I can not find any novel ideas or methods that try to improve or replace it (well, some variations exist, but nothing novel).</p>

<p>Though most people seem to ignore it or just accept it, EH <strong>has</strong> some huge drawbacks: exceptions are invisible to the code and it creates many, many possible exit points. Joel on software wrote an <a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2003/10/13.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">article about it</a>. The comparison to <code>goto</code> fits perfect, it made me think again about EH.</p>

<p>I try to avoid EH and just use return values, callbacks or whatever fits the purpose. But <strong>when you have to write reliable code, you just can't ignore EH these days</strong>: It starts with the <code>new</code>, which may throw an exception, instead of just returning 0 (like in the old days). This makes about any line of C++ code <em>vulnerable</em> to an exception. And then more places in the C++ foundational code throw exceptions... std lib does it, and so on.</p>

<p>This feels like <strong>walking on shaky grounds</strong>.. So, now we are forced to take care about exceptions!</p>

<p>But its hard, its really hard. You have to learn to write exception safe code, and even if you have some experience with it, it will still be required to double check any single line of code to be safe! Or you start to put try/catch blocks everywhere, which clutters the code until it reaches a state of unreadability.</p>

<p>EH replaced the old clean deterministical approach (return values..), which had just a few but understandable and easily solveable drawbacks with an approach that creates many possible exit points in your code, and if you start writing code that catches exceptions (what you are forced to do at some point), then it even creates a multitude of paths through your code (code in the catch blocks, think about a server program where you need logging facilities other than std::cerr ..). EH has advantages, but that's not the point.</p>

<p>My actual questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Do you really write exception safe code?</li>
<li>Are you sure your last ""production ready"" code is exception safe?</li>
<li>Can you even be sure, that it is?</li>

"1866794","<p>A long time ago I have read an article (I believe a blog entry) which put me on the ""right"" track on naming objects: Be very very scrupulous about naming things in your program.</p>

<p>For example if my application was (as a typical business app) handling users, companies and addresses I'd have a <code>User</code>, a <code>Company</code> and an <code>Address</code> domain class - and probably somewhere a <code>UserManager</code>, a <code>CompanyManager</code> and an <code>AddressManager</code> would pop up that handles those things.</p>

<p>So can you tell what those <code>UserManager</code>, <code>CompanyManager</code> and <code>AddressManager</code> do? No, because Manager is a very very generic term that fits to anything you can do with your domain objects.</p>

<p>The article I read recommended using very specific names. If it was a C++ application and the <code>UserManager</code>'s job was allocating and freeing users from the heap it would not manage the users but guard their birth and death. Hmm, maybe we could call this a <code>UserShepherd</code>.</p>

<p>Or maybe the <code>UserManager</code>'s job is to examine each User object's data and sign the data cryptographically. Then we'd have a <code>UserRecordsClerk</code>.</p>

<p>Now that this idea stuck with me I try to apply it. And find this simple idea amazingly hard.</p>

<p>I can describe what the classes do and (as long as I don't slip into quick &amp; dirty coding) the classes I write do exactly <strong>one</strong> thing. What I miss to go from that description to the names is a kind of catalogue of names, a vocabulary that maps the concepts to names.</p>

<p>Ultimately I'd like to have something like a pattern catalogue in my mind (frequently design patterns easily provide the object names, e.g. a <em>factory</em>)</p>

<ul>
<li>Factory - Creates other objects (naming taken from the design pattern)</li>

<p>Apparently in <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C99"" rel=""noreferrer"">C99</a> the following syntax is valid:</p>

<pre><code>void foo(int n) {
    int values[n]; //Declare a variable length array
}
</code></pre>

<p>This seems like a pretty useful feature. Was there ever a discussion about adding it to the C++ standard, and if so, why it was omitted?</p>

<p>Some potential reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>Hairy for compiler vendors to implement</li>
<li>Incompatible with some other part of the standard</li>
<li>Functionality can be emulated with other C++ constructs</li>
</ul>

<p>The C++ standard states that array size must be a constant expression (8.3.4.1).</p>

<p>Yes, of course I realize that in the toy example one could use <code>std::vector&lt;int&gt; values(m);</code>, but this allocates memory from the heap and not the stack. And if I want a multidimensional array like:</p>

<pre><code>void foo(int x, int y, int z) {
    int values[x][y][z]; // Declare a variable length array
}
</code></pre>

<p>the <code>vector</code> version becomes pretty clumsy:</p>

<pre><code>void foo(int x, int y, int z) {
    vector&lt; vector&lt; vector&lt;int&gt; &gt; &gt; values( /* Really painful expression here. */);
}
</code></pre>

<p>The slices, rows and columns will also potentially be spread all over memory.</p>

<p>Looking at the discussion at <code>comp.std.c++</code> it's clear that this question is pretty controversial with some very heavyweight names on both sides of the argument. It's certainly not obvious that a <code>std::vector</code> is always a better solution.</p>

<h3>Edit</h3>
<p>After using the base tag for a few weeks, I did end up finding some <strong>major</strong> gotchas with using the base tag that make it much less desirable than it first appeared.  Essentially, the changes to <code>href='#topic'</code> and <code>href=''</code> under the base tag are <em>very</em> incompatible with their default behavior, and this change from the default behavior could easily make third party libraries outside of your control <strong>very unreliable</strong>  in unexpected ways, since they will logically depend on the default behavior.  Often the changes are subtle and lead to not-immediately-obvious problems when dealing with a large codebase.  I have since created an answer detailing the issues that I experienced below.  So test the link results for yourself before you commit to a widespread deployment of <code>&lt;base&gt;</code>, is my new advice!</p>

"1933969","<p>I'm using HTML5 to program games; the obstacle I've run into now is how to play sound effects.</p>

<p>The specific requirements are few in number:</p>

<ul>
<li>Play and mix multiple sounds,</li>
<li>Play the same sample multiple times, possibly overlapping playbacks,</li>
<li>Interrupt playback of a sample at any point,</li>
<li>Preferably play WAV files containing (low quality) raw PCM, but I can convert these, of course.</li>
</ul>

<p>My first approach was to use the HTML5 <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> element and define all sound effects in my page. Firefox plays the WAV files just peachy, but calling <code>#play</code> multiple times doesn't really play the sample multiple times. From my understanding of the HTML5 spec, the <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> element also tracks playback state, so that explains why.</p>

<p>My immediate thought was to clone the audio elements, so I created the following tiny JavaScript library to do that for me (depends on jQuery):</p>

<pre><code>var Snd = {
  init: function() {
    $(""audio"").each(function() {
      var src = this.getAttribute('src');
      if (src.substring(0, 4) !== ""snd/"") { return; }
      // Cut out the basename (strip directory and extension)
      var name = src.substring(4, src.length - 4);
      // Create the helper function, which clones the audio object and plays it
      var Constructor = function() {};
      Constructor.prototype = this;
      Snd[name] = function() {
        var clone = new Constructor();
        clone.play();
        // Return the cloned element, so the caller can interrupt the sound effect
        return clone;
      };
    });
  }
};
</code></pre>

<p>So now I can do <code>Snd.boom();</code> from the Firebug console and play <code>snd/boom.wav</code>, but I still can't play the same sample multiple times. It seems that the <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> element is really more of a streaming feature rather than something to play sound effects with.</p>

<p>Is there a clever way to make this happen that I'm missing, preferably using only HTML5 and JavaScript?</p>

<p>I should also mention that, my test environment is Firefox 3.5 on Ubuntu 9.10. The other browsers I've tried - Opera, Midori, Chromium, Epiphany - produced varying results. Some don't play anything, and some throw exceptions.</p>

<li>Use <a href=""http://www.cython.org/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Cython</a> to expose the relevant parts from the C library to Python.</li>
<li>Do the whole thing in Python, using <a href=""http://docs.python.org/library/ctypes.html"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>ctypes</code></a> to communicate with the external library.</li>
</ol>

<p>I'm not sure whether 2) or 3) is the better choice. The advantage of 3) is that <code>ctypes</code> is part of the standard library, and the resulting code would be pure Python &ndash; although I'm not sure how big that advantage actually is.</p>

<p>Are there more advantages / disadvantages with either choice? Which approach do you recommend?</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Thanks for all your answers, they provide a good resource for anyone looking to do something similar. The decision, of course, is still to be made for the single case&mdash;there's no one ""This is the right thing"" sort of answer. For my own case, I'll probably go with ctypes, but I'm also looking forward to trying out Cython in some other project.</p>

<p>With there being no single true answer, accepting one is somewhat arbitrary; I chose FogleBird's answer as it provides some good insight into ctypes and it currently also is the highest-voted answer. However, I suggest to read all the answers to get a good overview.</p>

"1943576","<p>I am trying to get Unity to manage the creation of my objects and I want to have some initialization parameters that are not known until run-time:</p>

<p>At the moment the only way I could think of the way to do it is to have an Init method on the interface.</p>



<pre class=""lang-cs prettyprint-override""><code>interface IMyIntf {
  void Initialize(string runTimeParam);
  string RunTimeParam { get; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then to use it (in Unity) I would do this:</p>

<pre class=""lang-cs prettyprint-override""><code>var IMyIntf = unityContainer.Resolve&lt;IMyIntf&gt;();
IMyIntf.Initialize(""somevalue"");
</code></pre>

<p>In this scenario <code>runTimeParam</code> param is determined at run-time based on user input. The trivial case here simply returns the value of <code>runTimeParam</code> but in reality the parameter will be something like file name and initialize method will do something with the file.</p>

<p>This creates a number of issues, namely that the <code>Initialize</code> method is available on the interface and can be called multiple times. Setting a flag in the implementation and throwing exception on repeated call to <code>Initialize</code> seems way clunky.</p>

<p>At the point where I resolve my interface I don't want to know anything about the implementation of <code>IMyIntf</code>. What I do want, though, is the knowledge that this interface needs certain one time initialization parameters. Is there a way to somehow annotate(attributes?) the interface with this information and pass those to framework when the object is created?</p>

"1966425","<p>I need to highlight source code in LaTeX. The package <code>listings</code> seems to be the best choice for most use-cases and for me it was, until now.</p>

<p>However, now I need more flexibility. Generally, what I’m looking for is a <em>real</em> lexer. In particular, I need (for an own language definition) to define (and highlight!) own number styles. <code>listings</code> does not allow highlighting numbers in code. However, I need to produce something like this:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Hh4W1.png"" alt=""Required result""></p>

<p><code>listings</code> also cannot cope with arbitrary delimiters for strings. Consider the following valid Ruby code:</p>

<pre><code>s = %q!this is a string.!
</code></pre>

<p>Here, <code>!</code> can be replaced by almost <em>any</em> delimiter.</p>

<p>(That <code>listings</code> cannot handle Unicode is also quite vexing, but that’s another issue.)</p>

<p><strong>Ideally, I am looking for an extension of <code>listings</code> that allows me to provide more complex lexing rules. But barring that, I am also searching for viable alternatives.</strong></p>

<p><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/300521/latex-package-to-do-syntax-highlighting-of-code-in-various-languages/1452086#1452086"">Other threads</a> have suggested using <a href=""http://pygments.org/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Pygments</a> which can produce LaTeX output. There’s even a package – <a href=""http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/texments/"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>texments</code></a> – to ease the transition.</p>

<p>However, this sorely lacks features. In particular, I am interested in <code>listings</code>-style line numbering, source code line references, and the possibility of embedding LaTeX in source code (options <code>texcl</code> and <code>mathescape</code> in <code>listings</code>).</p>

<p>As an example, here’s a source code typeset with <code>listings</code> which shows some of the things that a replacement should also provide:</p>

<pre><code>var sys     = require('sys'),

    });
});

this.app = function(req, res) { 
    file.serveFile( req, res, 'file.js');  
}
</code></pre>

"1984186","<p>I am trying to use the perfmon windows utility to debug memory leaks in a process.</p>

<p>This is how perfmon explains the terms:</p>

<p><strong>Working Set</strong> is the current size, in bytes, of the Working Set of this process. The Working Set is the set of memory pages touched recently by the threads in the process. If free memory in the computer is above a threshold, pages are left in the Working Set of a process even if they are not in use.  When free memory falls below a threshold, pages are trimmed from Working Sets. If they are needed they will then be soft-faulted back into the Working Set before leaving main memory.</p>

<p><strong>Virtual Bytes</strong> is the current size, in bytes, of the virtual address space the process is using. Use of virtual address space does not necessarily imply corresponding use of either disk or main memory pages. Virtual space is finite, and the process can limit its ability to load libraries.</p>

<p><strong>Private Bytes</strong> is the current size, in bytes, of memory that this process has allocated that cannot be shared with other processes.</p>

<p>These are the questions I have:</p>

<p><em>Is it the Private Bytes which I should measure to be sure if the process is having any leaks as it does not involve any shared libraries and any leaks, if happening, will come from the process itself?</em></p>

<p><em>What is the total memory consumed by the process? Is it the Virtual Bytes or is it the sum of Virtual Bytes and Working Set?</em></p>

<p><em>Is there any relation between Private Bytes, Working Set and Virtual Bytes?</em></p>

"2001773","<p>I am looking for a way to wrap APIs around default functions in my PHP-based web applications, databases and CMSs. </p>

<p>I have looked around and found several ""skeleton"" frameworks. In addition to the answers in my question, there is <a href=""http://tonic.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Tonic</a>, a REST framework I like because it is very lightweight.</p>

<p>I like REST the best for its simplicity, and would like to create an API architecture based on it. I'm trying to get my head around the basic principles and have not fully understood it yet. Therefore, a number of questions.</p>

<p><strong>1. Am I understanding it right?</strong></p>

<p>Say I have a resource ""users"". I could set up a number of URIs like so:</p>

<pre><code>/api/users     when called with GET, lists users
/api/users     when called with POST, creates user record
/api/users/1   when called with GET, shows user record
               when called with PUT, updates user record
               when called with DELETE, deletes user record
</code></pre>

<p>is this a correct representation of a RESTful architecture so far?</p>

<p><strong>2. I need more verbs</strong></p>

<p>Create, Update and Delete may be enough in theory, but in practice I will have the need for a lot more verbs. I realize these are things that <em>could</em> be embedded in an update request, but they are specific actions that can have specific return codes and I wouldn't want to throw them all into one action.</p>

<p>Some that come to mind in the user example are:</p>

<pre><code>activate_login
deactivate_login
change_password
add_credit
</code></pre>

<p>how would I express actions such as those in a RESTful URL architecture?</p>

<p>My instinct would be to do a GET call to a URL like </p>

<pre><code>/api/users/1/activate_login 
</code></pre>

<p>and expect a status code back. </p>

<p>That deviates from the idea of using HTTP verbs, though. What do you think?</p>

<p><strong>3. How to return error messages and codes</strong></p>

<p>A great part of REST's beauty stems from its use of standard HTTP methods. On an error, I emit a header with a 3xx,4xx or 5xx error status code. For a detailed error description, I can use the body (right?). So far so good. But what would be the way to transmit a <strong>proprietary error code</strong> that is more detailed in describing what went wrong (e.g. ""failed to connect to database"", or ""database login wrong"")? If I put it into the body along with the message, I have to parse it out afterwards. Is there a standard header for this kind of thing?</p>

<p><strong>4. How to do authentication</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>What would a API key based authentication following REST principles look like?</li>
<li>Are there strong points against using sessions when authenticating a REST client, other than that it's a blatant violation of the REST principle? :) (only half kidding here, session based authentication would play well with my existing infrastructure.)</li>

thinking on how I should set up the database schema to keep an audit log of

<p>Some questions have already been asked here about this, but I don't agree that
there is a single best approach for all scenarios:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39281/database-design-for-revisions"">Database Design For Revisions</a></li>

<li><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1051449/ideas-on-database-design-for-capturing-audit-trails"">Ideas on database design for capturing audit trails</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I have also stumbled upon this <a href=""http://www.4guysfromrolla.com/webtech/041807-1.shtml"" rel=""noreferrer"">interesting article on Maintaining a Log of Database Changes</a> that tries to list the pro and cons of each approach. It's very well written and has interesting information, but it has made my decisions even harder.</p>

<p><strong>My question is:</strong> Is there a reference that I can use, maybe a book or something like a decision tree that I can refer to decide which way should I go based on some 
input variables, like:</p>

<ul>
<li>The maturity of the database schema</li>
<li>How the logs will be queried</li>
<li>The probability that it will be need to recreate records</li>
<li>What's more important: write or read performance</li>
<li>Nature of the values that are being logged (string, numbers, blobs)</li>
<li>Storage space available</li>
</ul>

<p>The approaches that I know are:</p>

<p><strong>1. Add columns for created and modified date and user</strong></p>

<p>Table example:</p>

<ul>
<li>id</li>
<li>value_1</li>
<li>value_2</li>
<li>value_3</li>
<li>created_date</li>
<li>modified_date</li>
<li>created_by</li>
<li>modified_by</li>
</ul>

<p>Major cons: We lose the history of the modifications. Can't rollback after commit.</p>

<p><strong>2. Insert only tables</strong></p>

<p><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1051449/ideas-on-database-design-for-capturing-audit-trails/1051494#1051494"">Table example</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li>id</li>
<li>value_1</li>
<li>value_2</li>
<li>value_3</li>
<li>from</li>
<li>to</li>
<li>deleted (Boolean)</li>
<li>user</li>
</ul>

<p>Major cons: How to keep foreign keys up to date? Huge space needed</p>

<p><strong>3. Create a Separate history table for each table</strong></p>

<p>History table example:</p>

<ul>
<li>id</li>
<li>value_1</li>
<li>value_2</li>
<li>value_3</li>
<li>value_4</li>
<li>user</li>
<li>deleted (Boolean)</li>
<li>timestamp</li>
</ul>

<p>Major cons: Needs to duplicate all audited tables. If the schema changes it will be needed to the migrate all the logs too.</p>

<p><strong>4. Create a Consolidated history Table for All Tables</strong></p>

<p>History table example:</p>

<ul>
<li>table_name</li>
<li>field</li>
<li>user</li>
<li>new_value</li>
<li>deleted (Boolean)</li>
<li>timestamp</li>
</ul>

<p>Major cons: Will I be able to recreate the records (rollback) if needed easily? The new_value column needs to be a huge string so it can support all different column types.</p>

"2033026","<p>I wonder if I should use the <a href=""http://www.jasig.org/cas"" rel=""noreferrer"">CAS</a> protocol or <a href=""http://oauth.net/"" rel=""noreferrer"">OAuth</a> + some authentication provider for single sign-on.</p>

<p>Example Scenario:</p>

<ol>
<li>A User tries to access a protected resource, but is not authenticated.</li>
<li>The application redirects the user to the SSO server.</li>
<li>If beeing authenticated the user gets a token from the SSO server.</li>
<li>The SSO redirects to the original application.</li>
<li>The original application checks the token against the SSO server.</li>
<li>If the token is ok, access will be allowed and the application knows of the user id.</li>
<li>The user performs a log-out and is logged out from all connected application at the same time (single sign-out).</li>
</ol>

<p>As far as I understand that is exactly what was CAS invented for. CAS clients have to implement the CAS protocol to use the authentication service. Now I'm wondering about to use CAS or OAuth at the client (consumer) site. Is OAuth a replacement for that part of CAS? Should OAuth as a new de-facto standard be preferred? Is there an easy to use (not Sun OpenSSO!) replacement for the authentication part of CAS supporting different methods like username/password, OpenID, TLS certifactes ...?</p>

<p>Context:</p>

<ul>
<li>Different applications should rely on the authentication of the SSO server and should use something session-like.</li>
<li>The applications can be GUI web applications or (REST) serivces.</li>
<li>The SSO server must be provide a user id, which is necessary to get more information about the user like roles, email and so on from a central user information store.</li>
<li>Single Sign-out should be possible.</li>
<li>Most clients are written in Java or PHP.</li>
</ul>

<p>I've just <a href=""http://hueniverse.com/2009/11/wrap-and-the-demise-of-the-oauth-community/"" rel=""noreferrer"">discovered WRAP</a>, which could become the OAuth successor. It is a new protocol specified by Microsoft, Google and Yahoo.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum</strong></p>

<p>I've learned that OAuth was not designed for authentication even it could be used to implement SSO, but only together with a SSO service like OpenID.</p>

<p>OpenID seems to me to be the ""new CAS"". CAS has some features OpenID misses (like single sign-out), but it should not be to hard to add the missing parts in a particular scenario. I think OpenID has broad acceptance and it is better to integrate OpenID into applications or application servers. I know that CAS also supports OpenID, but I think CAS is dispensable with OpenID.</p>

<p>Hehe, for every step I take in the Android world I run into some sort of problem =(</p>

<p>Apparently, you cannot quit an application in Android (but the Android system can very well totally destroy your app whenever it feels like it). What's up with that? I am starting to think that it's impossible to write an app that functions as a ""normal app"" - that the user can quit the app when he/she decides to do so. That is not something that should be relied upon the OS to do.</p>

<p>The application I am trying to create is not an application for the Android Market. It is not an application for ""wide use"" by the general public, it is a business app that is going to be used in a very narrow business field.</p>

<p>I was actually really looking forward to developing for the Android platform, since it addresses a lot of issues that exist in Windows Mobile and .NET.

FROM Orders
    INNER JOIN LineItems 
    ON Orders.OrderID = LineItems.OrderID
</code></pre>

<p>I want to show the single item on the order. But with this occasional order containing two (or more) items, the orders would <em>appear</em> be <strong>duplicated</strong>:</p>

<pre class=""lang-none prettyprint-override""><code>OrderNumber   Quantity   Description

<p>If I get adventurous, I might show the user, an ellipsis to indicate that there's more than one:</p>

<p>So the question is how to either</p>

<ul>
<li>eliminate ""duplicate"" rows</li>
<li>only join to one of the rows, to avoid duplication</li>
</ul>

<h2>First attempt</h2>

<p>My first naive attempt was to only join to the ""<strong>TOP 1</strong>"" line items:</p>

<p>But that gives the error:</p>

<ul>
<li>DI Agnostic - Although adding basic ""support"" for one or two of the common DI libraries (StructureMap, Ninject, etc) seems reasonable, I want consumers to be able to use the library with any DI framework.</li>
<li>Non-DI usable - If a consumer of the library is using no DI, the library should still be as easy to use as possible, reducing the amount of work a user has to do to create all these ""unimportant"" dependencies just to get to the ""real"" classes they want to use.</li>
</ul>

<li><p><strong>list</strong> (an ordered collection of values), and</p></li>
<li><p><strong>map-based type</strong> (an unordered array that maps keys to values)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>In the R programming language, the first two are implemented as <code>character</code> and <code>vector</code>, respectively.</p>

<p>When I began learning R, two things were obvious almost from the start: <code>list</code> is the most important data type in R (because it is the parent class for the R <code>data.frame</code>), and second, I just couldn't understand how they worked, at least not well enough to use them correctly in my code.</p>

<p>For one thing, it seemed to me that R's <code>list</code> data type was a straightforward implementation of the map ADT (<code>dictionary</code> in Python, <code>NSMutableDictionary</code> in Objective C, <code>hash</code> in Perl and Ruby, <code>object literal</code> in Javascript, and so forth).</p>

<p>For instance, you create them just like you would a Python dictionary, by passing key-value pairs to a constructor (which in Python is <code>dict</code> not <code>list</code>):</p>

<pre><code>x = list(""ev1""=10, ""ev2""=15, ""rv""=""Group 1"")
</code></pre>

<p>And you access the items of an R List just like you would those of a Python dictionary, e.g., <code>x['ev1']</code>. Likewise, you can retrieve just the <em>'keys'</em> or just the <em>'values'</em> by: </p>

<pre><code>names(x)    # fetch just the 'keys' of an R list
# [1] ""ev1"" ""ev2"" ""rv""

unlist(x)   # fetch just the 'values' of an R list
#   ev1       ev2        rv 
#  ""10""      ""15"" ""Group 1"" 

x = list(""a""=6, ""b""=9, ""c""=3)  

sum(unlist(x))
# [1] 18
</code></pre>

<p>but R <code>list</code>s are also <strong><em>unlike</em></strong> other map-type ADTs (from among the languages I've learned anyway). My guess is that this is a consequence of the initial spec for S, i.e., an intention to design a data/statistics DSL [domain-specific language] from the ground-up. </p>

<p><em>three</em> significant differences between R <code>list</code>s and mapping types in other languages in widespread use (e.g,. Python, Perl, JavaScript):</p>

<p><em>first</em>, <code>list</code>s in R are an <em>ordered</em> collection, just like vectors, even though the values are keyed (ie, the keys can be any hashable value not just sequential integers). Nearly always, the mapping data type in other languages is <em>unordered</em>.</p>

<p><em>second</em>, <code>list</code>s can be returned from functions even though you never passed in a <code>list</code> when you called the function, and <em>even though</em> the function that returned the <code>list</code> doesn't contain an (explicit) <code>list</code> constructor (Of course, you can deal with this in practice by wrapping the returned result in a call to <code>unlist</code>):</p>

<pre><code>x = strsplit(LETTERS[1:10], """")     # passing in an object of type 'character'

class(x)                            # returns 'list', not a vector of length 2
# [1] list
</code></pre>

<p>A <em>third</em> peculiar feature of R's <code>list</code>s: it doesn't seem that they can be members of another ADT, and if you try to do that then the primary container is coerced to a <code>list</code>. E.g.,</p>

<pre><code>x = c(0.5, 0.8, 0.23, list(0.5, 0.2, 0.9), recursive=TRUE)

class(x)
# [1] list
</code></pre>

<p>my intention here is not to criticize the language or how it is documented; likewise, I'm not suggesting there is anything wrong with the <code>list</code> data structure or how it behaves. All I'm after is to correct is my understanding of how they work so I can correctly use them in my code. </p>

<p>Here are the sorts of things I'd like to better understand:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>What are the rules which determine when a function call will return a <code>list</code> (e.g., <code>strsplit</code> expression recited above)?</p></li>
<li><p>If I don't explicitly assign names to a <code>list</code> (e.g., <code>list(10,20,30,40)</code>) are the default names just sequential integers beginning with 1?  (I assume, but I am far from certain that the answer is yes, otherwise we wouldn't be able to coerce this type of <code>list</code> to a vector w/ a call to <code>unlist</code>.)</p></li>
<li><p>Why do these two different operators, <code>[]</code>, and <code>[[]]</code>, return the <em>same</em> result?</p>

<p><code>x = list(1, 2, 3, 4)</code></p>

<p>both expressions return ""1"":</p>

<p><code>x[1]</code></p>

<p><code>x[[1]]</code></p></li>
<li><p>why do these two expressions <strong>not</strong> return the same result?</p>

<p><code>x = list(1, 2, 3, 4)</code></p>

<p><code>x2 = list(1:4)</code></p></li>
</ul>

<p>Please don't point me to the R Documentation (<a href=""http://www.inside-r.org/r-doc/base/list"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>?list</code></a>, <a href=""http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-devel/R-intro.html#Lists"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>R-intro</code></a>)--I have read it carefully and it does not help me answer the type of questions I recited just above.</p>

<li><a href=""http://code.google.com/p/django-openid-consumer/"" rel=""noreferrer"">django-openid-consumer</a>, a fork of Simon Willison's original django-openid. Seems more suited for simple blog comments than a full fledged registration workflow</li>

</ul>

<p>I played around with a couple of them. Simon Willison's <a href=""http://github.com/simonw/django-openid"" rel=""noreferrer"">django-openid</a> made a good impression, but as he is at the forefront of trendsetting in Djangoland, I sometimes have difficulties wrapping my head around his trends (e.g. the whole dynamic urlpatterns system in django-openid). What's more, I couldn't get login to work with Google.</p>

<p><a href=""http://bitbucket.org/benoitc/django-authopenid/wiki/Home"" rel=""noreferrer"">django-authopenid</a> made a good impression, and it seems to have good integration with <a href=""http://bitbucket.org/ubernostrum/django-registration/wiki/Home"" rel=""noreferrer"">django-registration</a>. <a href=""http://github.com/uswaretech/Django-Socialauth"" rel=""noreferrer"">django-socialauth</a> and <a href=""http://github.com/flashingpumpkin/django-socialregistration"" rel=""noreferrer"">django-socialregistration</a> have support for Twitter and Facebook, which is definitely a plus.

"2156120","<p>I'm wondering if there is a recommended way of doing deep clone/copy of instance in java.</p>

<p>I have 3 solutions in mind, but I can have miss some,  and I'd like to have your opinion</p>

<p>edit: include Bohzo propositon and refine question: it's more about deep cloning than shallow cloning.</p>

<h2>Do it yourself:</h2>

<p>code the clone by hand properties after properties and check that mutable instances are cloned too.<br>
<strong>pro:</strong><br>
- control of what will be performed<br>
- quick execution<br>
<strong>cons:</strong><br>
- tedious to write and maintain<br>
- bug prone (copy/paste failure, missing property, reassigned mutable property) </p>

<h2>Use reflection:</h2>

<p>With your own reflection tools or with an external helper (like jakarta common-beans) it is easy to write a generic copy method that will do the job in one line.<br>
<strong>pro:</strong><br>
- easy to write<br>
- no maintenance<br>
<strong>cons:</strong><br>
- less control of what happens<br>
- bug prone with mutable object if the reflection tool does not clone sub objects too<br>
- slower execution</p>

<h2>Use clone framework:</h2>

<p>Use a framework that do it for you, like :<br>
<a href=""http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-lang/javadocs/api-3.0.1/org/apache/commons/lang3/SerializationUtils.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">commons-lang SerializationUtils</a><br>

<a href=""http://dozer.sourceforge.net/documentation/about.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Dozer</a><br>
<a href=""https://github.com/EsotericSoftware/kryo"" rel=""noreferrer"">Kryo</a></p>

<p><strong>pro:</strong><br>
- same as reflection<br>
- more control over what will be exactly be cloned.<br>
<strong>cons:</strong><br>
- every mutable instance is fully cloned, even at the end of the hierarchy<br>
- could be very slow to execute</p>

<h2>Use bytecode instrumentation to write clone at runtime</h2>

<p><a href=""http://www.jboss.org/javassist"" rel=""noreferrer"">javassit</a>, <a href=""http://jakarta.apache.org/bcel/index.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">BCEL</a> or <a href=""http://cglib.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""noreferrer"">cglib</a> might be use to generate a dedicated cloner as fast as one hand writed. Someone knows a lib using one of these tools for this purpose ?</p>

<p>This is my mindset about different interfaces:</p>

<p>A TV remote is an interface between the user and the TV. It is an existing entity, but useless (doesn't provide any functionality) by itself. All the functionality for each of those buttons on the remote is implemented in the television set.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Interface:</strong> It is an ""existing entity"" layer between the
  <code>functionality</code> and <code>consumer</code> of that functionality. An interface by itself
  doesn't do anything. It just invokes the functionality lying behind.</p>
  
  <p>Now depending on who the user is there are different type of interfaces.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Command Line Interface (CLI)</strong> commands are the existing entities,
  the consumer is the user and functionality lies behind.</p>
  
  <p><code>functionality:</code> my software functionality which solves some
  purpose to which we are describing this interface.</p>
  
  <p><code>existing entities:</code> commands</p>
  
  <p><code>consumer:</code> user</p>
  
  <p><strong>Graphical User Interface(GUI)</strong> window, buttons, etc. are the existing
  entities, and again the consumer is the user and functionality lies behind.</p>
  
  <p><code>functionality:</code> my software functionality which solves some problem to which we are describing this interface.</p>
  
  <p><code>existing entities:</code> window, buttons etc..</p>
  
  <p><code>consumer:</code> user</p>
  
  <p><strong>Application Programming Interface(API)</strong> functions (or to be
  more correct) interfaces (in interfaced based programming) are the
  existing entities, consumer here is another program not a user, and again
  functionality lies behind this layer.</p>
  
  <p><code>functionality:</code> my software functionality which solves some
  problem to which we are describing this interface.</p>
  
  <p><code>existing entities:</code> functions, Interfaces (array of functions).</p>
  
  <p><code>consumer:</code> another program/application.</p>

"2180460","<p>I am a lone developer most of my time, working on a number of big, mainly PHP-based projects. I want to professionalize and automate how changes to the code base are handled, and create a Continuous Integration process that makes the transition to work in a team possible without having to make fundamental changes. </p>

<p>What I am doing right now is, I have a local test environment for every project; I use SVN for each project; changes are tested locally, and then transferred to the on-line version, usually via FTP. API documentation is generated manually from the source code; Unit tests are something I am getting into slowly, and it's not yet part of my daily routine.</p>

<p>The ""build cycle"" I am envisioning would do the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>A changeset gets checked into SVN after having been tested locally.</p></li>
<li><p>I start the build process. The SVN HEAD revision gets checked out, modified if necessary, and made ready for upload.</p></li>
<li><p>API Documentation gets generated automatically - if I haven't set it up in detail yet, using a default template, scanning the whole code base.</p></li>
<li><p>The new revision is deployed to the remote location via FTP (Including some directory renaming, chmodding, importing databases, and the likes.) This is something I already like <a href=""http://phing.info/"" rel=""noreferrer"">phing</a> for very much, but I'm open for alternatives of course.</p></li>
<li><p>Unit tests residing in a predefined location are run. I am informed about their failure or success using E-Mail, RSS or (preferably) HTML output that I can grab and put into a web page.</p></li>
<li><p>(optionally) a end-user ""changelog"" text file in a pre-defined location gets updated with a pre-defined part of the commit message (""It is now possible to filter for both ""foo"" and ""bar"" at the same time). This message is not necessarily identical with the SVN commit message, which probably contains much more internal information.</p></li>
<li><p>Stuff like code metrics, code style checking and so on are not my primary focus right now, but on the long run, they certainly will. Solutions that bring this out-of-the-box are very kindly looked upon.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I am looking for</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Feedback and experiences</strong> from people who are or were in a similar situation, and have successfully implemented a solution for this</p></li>
<li><p>Especially, <strong>good step-by-step tutorials and walkthroughs</strong> on how to set this up</p></li>
<li><p>Solutions that provide <strong>as much automation as possible</strong>, for example by creating  a skeleton API, test cases and so on for each new project.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>and also</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Product recommendations</strong>. What I know so far is <a href=""http://phing.info/"" rel=""noreferrer"">phing</a>/ant for building, and <a href=""http://phpundercontrol.org/about.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">phpUnderControl</a> or <a href=""http://hudson-ci.org/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Hudson</a> for the reporting part. I like them all as far as I can see, but I have of course no detailed experience with them.</li>
</ul>

<p>I am <em>swamped</em> with work, so I have a strong inclination towards simple solutions. On the other hand, if a feature is missing, I'll cry about it being too limited. :) Point-and-click solutions are welcome, too. I am also to commercial product recommendations that can work with PHP projects.</p>

<p><strong>My setup</strong></p>

<p>I am working on Windows locally (7, to be exact) and most client projects are run on a LAMP stack, often on shared hosting (= no remote SSH).
I am looking for solutions that I can run in my own environment. I am ready to set up a Linux VM for this, no problem. Hosted solutions are interesting for me only if they provide all of the aspects described, or are flexible enough to interact with the other parts of the process.</p>

"2193953","<p>I have a Flash project, and it has many source files. I have a fairly heavily-used class, call it Jenine. I recently (and, perhaps, callously) relocated Jenine from one namespace to another. I thought we were ready - I thought it was time. The new Jenine was better in every way - she had lost some code bloat, she had decoupled herself from a few vestigial class relationships, and she had finally come home to the namespace that she had always secretly known in her heart was the one she truly belonged to. She was among her own kind.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Flash would have none of that. Perhaps it had formed an attachment. Perhaps it didn't <em>want</em> Jenine to be decoupled. Either way, it clung to the old, perfect version of Jenine in its memory. It refused to move on. It ignored her (function) calls. It tried to forget her new, public interfaces. Instead, every instance of Jenine that it constructed was always a copy of the old version, down to its classpath:</p>

<pre><code>var jenineInstance:Jenine = new Jenine();
trace( getQualifiedClassName(jenineInstance));
// Should print: com.newnamespace.subspace::Jenine
// Prints: com.oldnamespace.subspace::Jenine
// Ah, young love!
</code></pre>

<p>We fought. I'm not proud of some of the things I said or did. In the end, in a towering fit of rage, I deleted all references of Jenine completely. She was utterly, completely erased from the system. My cursor fell upon the ""Empty Trash"" menu option like the cold lid of a casket.</p>

<p>I don't think Flash ever recovered. To this day it still clings to the memory of Jenine. Her old, imperfect definitions still float through my project like abandoned ghosts. Whenever I force Flash to compile, it still lovingly inserts her into my movie, nestling her definition in amongst the other, living classes, like a small shrine. I wonder if they can see her.</p>

<p>Flash and I don't really talk anymore. I write my code, it compiles it. There's a new girl in town named Summer who looks almost identical to Jenine, as if someone had just copied her source-code wholesale into a new class, but Flash hasn't shown any interest. Most days it just mopes around and writes bad poetry in my comments when it thinks I'm not looking.</p>

<p>I hope no one else has had a similar experience, that this is just a singular, painful ripple in the horrifying dark lagoon that is the Flash code-base. Does anyone have any idea how to erase whatever cache the compiler is using?</p>

"2196995","<p>A recent talk about <code>unordered_map</code> in C++ made me realize that I should use <code>unordered_map</code> for most cases where I used <code>map</code> before, because of the efficiency of lookup ( <em>amortized O(1)</em> vs. <em>O(log n)</em> ). Most times I use a map, I use either <code>int</code> or <code>std::string</code> as the key type; hence, I've got no problems with the definition of the hash function. The more I thought about it, the more I came to realize that I can't find any reason of using a <code>std::map</code> over a <code>std::unordered_map</code> in the case of keys with simple types -- I took a look at the interfaces, and didn't find any significant differences that would impact my code. </p>

<p>Hence the question: is there any real reason to use <code>std::map</code> over <code>std::unordered_map</code> in the case of simple types like <code>int</code> and <code>std::string</code>?</p>

<p>I'm asking from a strictly programming point of view -- I know that it's not fully considered standard, and that it may pose problems with porting.</p>

<p>Also, I expect that one of the correct answers might be <em>""it's more efficient for smaller sets of data""</em> because of a smaller overhead (is that true?) -- hence I'd like to restrict the question to cases where the amount of keys is non-trivial (>1 024).</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> <em>duh, I forgot the obvious (thanks GMan!) -- yes, maps are ordered of course -- I know that, and am looking for other reasons.</em></p>

"2224844","<p>I'm trying to get the absolute screen pixel coordinates of the top left corner of a view. However, all methods I can find such as <code>getLeft()</code> and <code>getRight()</code> don't work as they all seem to be relative to the parent of the view, thus giving me <code>0</code>. What is the proper way to do this?</p>

<p>If it helps, this is for a 'put the picture back in order' game. I want the user to be able to draw a box to select multiple pieces. My assumption is that the easiest way to do that is to <code>getRawX()</code> and <code>getRawY()</code> from the <code>MotionEvent</code> and then compare those values against the top left corner of the layout holding the pieces. Knowing the size of the pieces, I can then determine how many pieces have been selected. I realise I can use <code>getX()</code> and <code>getY()</code> on the <code>MotionEvent</code>, but as that returns a relative position that makes determining which pieces were selected more difficult. (Not impossible, I know, but it seems unnecessarily complicated).</p>

<p>Edit: This is the code I used to try to get the size of the holding container, as per one of the questions. <code>TableLayout</code> is the table which holds all the puzzle pieces.</p>

<pre><code>TableLayout tableLayout = (TableLayout) findViewById(R.id.tableLayout);
Log.d(LOG_TAG, ""Values "" + tableLayout.getTop() + tableLayout.getLeft());
</code></pre>

<p>Edit 2: Here is the code I've tried, following more of the suggested answers.</p>

<pre><code>public int[] tableLayoutCorners = new int[2];
(...)

TableLayout tableLayout = (TableLayout) findViewById(R.id.tableLayout);
tableLayout.requestLayout();
Rect corners = new Rect();
tableLayout.getLocalVisibleRect(corners);
Log.d(LOG_TAG, ""Top left "" + corners.top + "", "" + corners.left + "", "" + corners.right
            + "", "" + corners.bottom);

cells[4].getLocationOnScreen(tableLayoutCorners);
Log.d(LOG_TAG, ""Values "" + tableLayoutCorners[0] + "", "" + tableLayoutCorners[1]);
</code></pre>

<p>This code was added after all the initialisation is done. The image has been divided up into a array of ImageViews (the cells[] array) contained within a <code>TableLayout</code>. Cells[0] is the top left <code>ImageView</code>, and I picked cells[4] as it's somewhere in the middle and most definitely should not have coordinates of (0,0).</p>

<p>The code shown above still gives me all 0s in the logs, which I really don't understand because the various puzzle pieces are correctly displayed. (I tried public int for tableLayoutCorners and default visibility, both giving the same result.)</p>

<p>I don't know if this is significant, but the <code>ImageView</code>s are originally not given a size. The size of the <code>ImageView</code>s is determined during the initialisation automatically by the View when I give it an image to display. Could this contribute to their values being 0, even though that logging code is after they have been given an image and have automatically resized themselves? To potentially counter that, I added the code <code>tableLayout.requestLayout()</code> as shown above, but that didn't help.</p>

<p>The task that needs to be executed is not in my control. It can be any piece of code. The problem is this piece of code might run into an infinite loop. I don't want that to happen. So, I just want to run that task in a separate thread.

"2283937","<p>As I continue to build more and more websites and web applications I am often asked to store user's passwords in a way that they can be retrieved if/when the user has an issue (either to email a forgotten password link, walk them through over the phone, etc.)  When I can I fight bitterly against this practice and I do a lot of ‘extra’ programming to make password resets and administrative assistance possible without storing their actual password.</p>

<p>When I can’t fight it (or can’t win) then I always encode the password in some way so that it, at least, isn’t stored as plaintext in the database—though I am aware that if my DB gets hacked it wouldn't take much for the culprit to crack the passwords, so that makes me uncomfortable.</p>

<p>In a perfect world folks would update passwords frequently and not duplicate them across many different sites—unfortunately I know MANY people that have the same work/home/email/bank password, and have even freely given it to me when they need assistance.  I don’t want to be the one responsible for their financial demise if my DB security procedures fail for some reason.</p>

<p>Morally and ethically I feel responsible for protecting what can be, for some users, their livelihood even if they are treating it with much less respect.
I am certain that there are many avenues to approach and arguments to be made for salting hashes and different encoding options, but is there a single ‘best practice’ when you have to store them?  In almost all cases I am using PHP and MySQL if that makes any difference in the way I should handle the specifics.</p>

<p><strong>Additional Information for Bounty</strong></p>

<p>I want to clarify that I know this is not something you want to have to do and that in most cases refusal to do so is best.  I am, however, not looking for a lecture on the merits of taking this approach I am looking for the best steps to take if you do take this approach.</p>

<p>In a note below I made the point that websites geared largely toward the elderly, mentally challenged, or very young can become confusing for people when they are asked to perform a secure password recovery routine.  Though we may find it simple and mundane in those cases some users need the extra assistance of either having a service tech help them into the system or having it emailed/displayed directly to them.  </p>

<p>In such systems the attrition rate from these demographics could hobble the application if users were not given this level of access assistance, so please answer with such a setup in mind.</p>

<p><strong>Thanks to Everyone</strong></p>

<p>This has been a fun question with lots of debate and I have enjoyed it.  In the end I selected an answer that both retains password security (I will not have to keep plain text or recoverable passwords), but also makes it possible for the user base I specified to log into a system without the major drawbacks I have found from normal password recovery.</p>

<p>As always there were about 5 answers that I would like to have marked as correct for different reasons, but I had to choose the best one--all the rest got a +1.  Thanks everyone!</p>

<p>Also, thanks to everyone in the Stack community who voted for this question and/or marked it as a favorite.  I take hitting 100 up votes as a compliment and hope that this discussion has helped someone else with the same concern that I had.</p>

"2290016","<p>Tim Pope argues for a particular Git commit message style in his blog post:
<a href=""http://www.tpope.net/node/106"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://www.tpope.net/node/106</a>.</p>

<p>Here is a quick summary of what he recommends:</p>

<ul>
<li>First line is 50 characters or less.</li>
<li>Then a blank line.</li>
<li>Remaining text should be wrapped at 72 characters.</li>
</ul>

<p>His blog post gives the rationale for these recommendations (which I will call “50/72 formatting” for brevity):</p>

<ul>
<li>In practice, some tools treat the first line as a subject line and the second paragraph as a body (similar to email).</li>
<li><code>git log</code> does not handle wrapping, so it is hard to read if lines are too long.</li>
<li><code>git format-patch --stdout</code> converts commits to email — so to play nice it helps if your commits are already wrapped nicely.</li>
</ul>

<p>A point I would like to add that I think Tim would agree with:</p>

<ul>
<li>The act of summarizing your commit is a good practice inherently in any version control system. It helps others (or a later you) find relevant commits more quickly.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, I have a couple of angles to my question:</p>

<ul>
<li>What chunk (roughly) of the “thought leaders” or “experienced users” of Git embrace the 50/72 formatting style? I ask this because sometime newer users don’t know or don’t care about community practices.</li>
<li>For those that don’t use this formatting, is there a principled reason for using a different formatting style? (Please note that I’m looking for an argument on the merits, not “I’ve never heard of it” or “I don’t care.”)</li>
<li>Empirically speaking, what percentage of Git repositories embrace this style? (In case someone wants to do an analysis on GitHub repositories… hint, hint.)</li>
</ul>

<p>My point here is not to recommend the 50/72 style or shoot down other styles. (To be open about it, I do prefer it, but I am open to other ideas.) I just want to get the rationale for why people like or oppose various Git commit message styles. (Feel free to bring up points that haven’t been mentioned, too.)</p>

"2303690","<p>I'm trying to create a thumbnail image on the client side using javascript and a canvas element, but when I shrink the image down, it looks terrible.  It looks as if it was downsized in photoshop with the resampling set to 'Nearest Neighbor' instead of Bicubic.  I know its possible to get this to look right, because <a href=""http://www.rigasa.ch/~labo/labo/pixastic/editor/"" rel=""noreferrer"">this site</a> can do it just fine using a canvas as well.  I've tried using the same code they do as shown in the ""[Source]"" link, but it still looks terrible.  Is there something I'm missing, some setting that needs to be set or something?</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>I'm trying to resize a jpg.  I have tried resizing the same jpg on the linked site and in photoshop, and it looks fine when downsized.</p>

<p>Here is the relevant code:</p>

<pre><code>reader.onloadend = function(e)
{
    var img = new Image();
    var ctx = canvas.getContext(""2d"");
    var canvasCopy = document.createElement(""canvas"");
    var copyContext = canvasCopy.getContext(""2d"");

    img.onload = function()
    {
        var ratio = 1;

        if(img.width &gt; maxWidth)
            ratio = maxWidth / img.width;
        else if(img.height &gt; maxHeight)
            ratio = maxHeight / img.height;

        canvasCopy.width = img.width;
        canvasCopy.height = img.height;
        copyContext.drawImage(img, 0, 0);

        canvas.width = img.width * ratio;
        canvas.height = img.height * ratio;
        ctx.drawImage(canvasCopy, 0, 0, canvasCopy.width, canvasCopy.height, 0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
    };

    img.src = reader.result;
}
</code></pre>

<p>EDIT2:</p>

<p>Seems I was mistaken, the linked website wasn't doing any better of a job of downsizing the image.  I tried the other methods suggested and none of them look any better.  This is what the different methods resulted in:</p>

</code></pre>

<p>is actually undefined behaviour I.e. reading from a member of the union other than the one recently written to leads to undefined behaviour. If this isn't the intended usage of unions, what is? Can some one please explain it elaborately?</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>I wanted to clarify a few things in hindsight.</p>

<ul>
<li>The answer to the question isn't the same for C and C++; my ignorant younger self tagged it as both C and C++.</li>
<li>After scouring through C++11's standard I couldn't conclusively say that it calls out accessing/inspecting a non-active union member is undefined/unspecified/implementation-defined. All I could find was §9.5/1:

<blockquote>
  <p>If a standard-layout union contains several standard-layout structs that share a common initial sequence, and if an object of this standard-layout union type contains one of the standard-layout structs, it is permitted to inspect the common initial sequence of any of standard-layout struct members. §9.2/19: Two standard-layout structs share a common initial sequence if corresponding members have layout-compatible types and either neither member is a bit-field or both are bit-fields with the same width for a sequence of one or more initial members.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li>While in C, (<a href=""http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/dr_283.htm"" rel=""noreferrer"">C99 TC3 - DR 283</a> onwards) it's legal to do so (<a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2310483/purpose-of-unions-in-c-and-c#comment26826326_2313676"">thanks to Pascal Cuoq</a> for bringing this up). However, attempting to do <em>it can still lead to undefined behavior</em>, if the value read happens to be invalid (so called ""trap representation"") for the type it is read through. Otherwise, the value read is implementation defined.</li>
<li><p>C89/90 called this out under unspecified behavior (Annex J) and K&amp;R's book says it's implementation defined. Quote from K&amp;R:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is the purpose of a union - a single variable that can legitimately hold any of one of several types. [...] so long as the usage is consistent: the type retrieved must be the type most recently stored. It is the programmer's responsibility to keep track of which type is currently stored in a union; the results are implementation-dependent if something is stored as one type and extracted as another.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Extract from Stroustrup's TC++PL (emphasis mine)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Use of unions can be essential for compatness of data [...] <em>sometimes misused for ""type conversion</em>"".</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>

<p><em>Above all, this question (whose title remains unchanged since my ask) was posed with an intention of understanding the purpose of unions AND not on what the standard allows</em> E.g. Using inheritance for code reuse is, of course, allowed by the C++ standard, but <a href=""https://isocpp.org/wiki/faq/objective-c#objective-c-and-inherit"" rel=""noreferrer"">it wasn't the purpose or the original intention of introducing inheritance as a C++ language feature</a>.

<p>I read that there should be a way to to ""encode"" my custom object and then put it in, but I'm not sure how to implement it, help would be appreciated!  Thank you!</p>

<p>****EDIT****</p>

<p>Alright, so I worked with the code given below (Thank you!), but I'm still having some issues.  Basically, the code crashes now and I'm not sure why, because it doesn't give any errors.  Perhaps I'm missing something basic and I'm just too tired, but we'll see.  Here is the implementation of my Custom class, ""Player"":</p>

<pre><code>@interface Player : NSObject {
    NSString *name;
    NSNumber *life;
    //Log of player's life
}
//Getting functions, return the info
- (NSString *)name;
- (int)life;


- (id)init;

//These are the setters
- (void)setName:(NSString *)input; //string
- (void)setLife:(NSNumber *)input; //number    

@end
</code></pre>

<p>Implementation File:</p>

<pre><code>#import ""Player.h""
@implementation Player
- (id)init {
    if (self = [super init]) {
        [self setName:@""Player Name""];
        [self setLife:[NSNumber numberWithInt:20]];
        [self setPsnCounters:[NSNumber numberWithInt:0]];
    }
    return self;
}

- (NSString *)name {return name;}
- (int)life {return [life intValue];}
- (void)setName:(NSString *)input {
    [input retain];
    if (name != nil) {
        [name release];
    }
    name = input;
}
- (void)setLife:(NSNumber *)input {
    [input retain];
    if (life != nil) {
        [life release];
    }
    life = input;
}
/* This code has been added to support encoding and decoding my objecst */

<p>So that's my class, pretty straight forward, I know it works in making my objects.  So here is the relevant parts of the AppDelegate file (where I call the encryption and decrypt functions):</p>

<p>And then the important parts of the implementation file:</p>

    return obj;
}

<p>Eeee, sorry about all the code.  Just trying to help.  Basically, the app will launch and then crash immediatly.

<li>Sessions is the main table

<ul>
<li>A teacher is linked to each session</li>
<li>A statusid is given to each session. E.g. 0 - Completed, 1 - Cancelled</li>

<p>I ""designed"" (more like scribbled) the schema on a piece of paper, trying to keep it normalised to the 3rd form.

<h2>Example queries I'll be running</h2>

<ul>
<li>Which clients with credit still left are inactive (those without a class scheduled in the future)</li>
<li>What is the attendance rate per client/department/division (measured by the status id in each session)</li>
<li>How many classes has a teacher had in a month</li>
<li>Flag clients who have low attendance rate</li>
<li>Custom reports for HR departments with attendance rates of people in their division</li>
</ul>

<h1>Question(s)</h1>

<ul>
<li><strong>Is this overengineered or am I headed the right way?</strong></li>
<li>Will the need to join multiple tables for most queries result in a big performance hit?</li>
<li>I have added a 'lastsession' column to clients, as it is probably going to be a common query. Is this a good idea or should I keep the database strictly normalised?</li>

<p>The obvious answer is to set the TextView to fill_parent on height, but this causes no room to be left for the button or entry field.</p>

<p>Essentially the issue is that I want the submit button and the text entry to be a fixed height at the bottom and the text view to fill the rest of the space. Similarly, in the horizontal linear layout I want the submit button to wrap its content and for the text entry to fill the rest of the space.</p>

<p>If the first item in a linear layout is told to fill_parent it does exactly that, leaving no room for other items. How do I get an item which is first in a linear layout to fill all space apart from the minimum required by the rest of the items in the layout?</p>

In addition, no one seemed to dare to upvote, nor downvote my answer.</p>

<p>I was told there that it's bad practice, but then I was also told that garbage collector runs don't systematically stop the world anymore, and that it could also effectively be used by the JVM only as a hint, so I'm kind of at loss.</p>

<p>I do understand that the JVM usually knows better than you when it needs to reclaim memory. I also understand that worrying about a few kilobytes of data is silly. I also understand that even megabytes of data isn't what it was a few years back. But still, 1.5 gigabytes? And you <em>know</em> there's like 1.5 GB of data hanging around in memory; it's not like it's a shot in the dark. Is <code>System.gc()</code> systematically bad, or is there some point at which it becomes okay?</p>

<p>So the question is actually double:</p>

<ul>
<li>Why is or isn't it bad practice to call <code>System.gc()</code>? Is it really merely a hint to the JVM under certain implementations, or is it always a full collection cycle?

data.load();
data.show();
</code></pre>

<p>If I comment the Log line, then the condition applies to the next line, and chances are load() is not called. Are such situations rare enough that I can decide it should not exist?</p>

<p>So, is there a better source code-level way to do that? Or maybe some clever ProGuard syntax to efficiently but safely remove all Log lines?</p>

"2463175","<p>I'm writing my first Android application and trying to get my head around communication between services and activities. I have a Service that will run in the background and do some gps and time based logging. I will have an Activity that will be used to start and stop the Service. </p>

<p>So first, I need to be able to figure out if the Service is running when the Activity is started. There are some other questions here about that, so I think I can figure that out (but feel free to offer advice).</p>

<p>My real problem: if the Activity is running and the Service is started, I need a way for the Service to send messages to the Activity. Simple Strings and integers at this point - status messages mostly. The messages will not happen regularly, so I don't think polling the service is a good way to go if there is another way. I only want this communication when the Activity has been started by the user - I don't want to start the Activity from the Service. In other words, if you start the Activity and the Service is running, you will see some status messages in the Activity UI when something interesting happens. If you don't start the Activity, you will not see these messages (they're not that interesting).</p>

<p>It seems like I should be able to determine if the Service is running, and if so, add the Activity as a listener. Then remove the Activity as a listener when the Activity pauses or stops. Is that actually possible? The only way I can figure out to do it is to have the Activity implement Parcelable and build an AIDL file so I can pass it through the Service's remote interface. That seems like overkill though, and I have no idea how the Activity should implement writeToParcel() / readFromParcel().</p>

<p>Is there an easier or better way? Thanks for any help.</p>

"2473989","<p>After using PHP for a while now, I've noticed that not all built-in PHP functions are as fast as expected. Consider these two possible implementations of a function that finds if a number is prime using a cached array of primes.</p>

<pre><code>//very slow for large $prime_array
$prime_array = array( 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, .... 104729, ... );
$result_array = array();
foreach( $prime_array =&gt; $number ) {
    $result_array[$number] = in_array( $number, $large_prime_array );
}

//speed is much less dependent on size of $prime_array, and runs much faster.
$prime_array =&gt; array( 2 =&gt; NULL, 3 =&gt; NULL, 5 =&gt; NULL, 7 =&gt; NULL,
                       11 =&gt; NULL, 13 =&gt; NULL, .... 104729 =&gt; NULL, ... );
foreach( $prime_array =&gt; $number ) {
    $result_array[$number] = array_key_exists( $number, $large_prime_array );
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is because <code>in_array</code> is implemented with a linear search O(n) which will linearly slow down as <code>$prime_array</code> grows. Where the <code>array_key_exists</code> function is implemented with a hash lookup O(1) which will not slow down unless the hash table gets extremely populated (in which case it's only O(n)).</p>

<p>So far I've had to discover the big-O's via trial and error, and occasionally <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2350361/how-is-the-php-array-implemented-on-the-c-level"">looking at the source code</a>. Now for the question...</p>

<p>My understanding is this: any time a variable may be changed outside the flow of control of a piece of code accessing it, that variable should be declared to be <code>volatile</code>.  Signal handlers, I/O registers, and variables modified by another thread all constitute such situations.</p>

<p>So, if you have a global int <code>foo</code>, and <code>foo</code> is read by one thread and set atomically by another thread (probably using an appropriate machine instruction), the reading thread sees this situation in the same way it sees a variable tweaked by a signal handler or modified by an external hardware condition and thus <code>foo</code> should be declared <code>volatile</code> (or, for multithreaded situations, accessed with memory-fenced load, which is probably a better a solution).</p>

"2510975","<p>Does anyone have a good resource on implementing a shared object pool strategy for a limited resource in vein of Sql connection pooling? (ie would be implemented fully that it is thread safe).</p>

<p>To follow up in regards to @Aaronaught request for clarification the pool usage would be for load balancing requests to an external service. To put it in a scenario that would probably be easier to immediately understand as opposed to my direct situtation. I have a session object that functions similarly to the <code>ISession</code> object from NHibernate. That each unique session manages it's connection to the database. Currently I have 1 long running session object and am encountering issues where my service provider is rate limiting my usage of this individual session.</p>

<p>Due to their lack of expectation that a single session would be treated as a long running service account they apparently treat it as a client that is hammering their service. Which brings me to my question here, instead of having 1 individual session I would create a pool of different sessions and split the requests up to the service across those multiple sessions instead of creating a single focal point as I was previously doing.</p>

<p>Hopefully that background offers some value but to directly answer some of your questions:</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> Are the objects expensive to create?<br>
<strong>A:</strong> No objects are a pool of limited resources</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> Will they be acquired/released very frequently?<br>
<strong>A:</strong> Yes, once again they can be thought of NHibernate ISessions where 1 is usually acquired and released for the duration of every single page request.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> Will a simple first-come-first-serve suffice or do you need something more intelligent, i.e. that would prevent starvation?<br>
<strong>A:</strong> A simple round robin type distribution would suffice, by starvation I assume you mean if there are no available sessions that callers become blocked waiting for releases. This isn't really applicable since the sessions can be shared by different callers. My goal is distribute the usage across multiple sessions as opposed to 1 single session.</p>

<p>I believe this is probably a divergence from a normal usage of an object pool which is why I originally left this part out and planned just to adapt the pattern to allow sharing of objects as opposed to allowing a starvation situation to ever occur.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> What about things like priorities, lazy vs. eager loading, etc.?<br>
<strong>A:</strong> There is no prioritization involved, for simplicity's sake just assume that I would create the pool of available objects at the creation of the pool itself.</p>

<p><strong>If you have anything to add, please do</strong></p>

<p>Many systems are dependent on keeping accurate time, the problem is with changes to time due to daylight savings - moving the clock forward or backwards.</p>

<p>For instance, one has business rules in an order taking system that depend on the time of the order - if the clock changes, the rules might not be as clear. How should the time of the order be persisted? There are of course an endless number of scenarios - this one is simply an illustrative one.</p>

""ackoverflowst""
""overflowstack""

<p>where as <code>""stackoverflwo""</code> is <strong><em>not</em></strong> a rotated version.</p>

<p>The answer he gave was:<br></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Take <code>s2</code> and find the longest prefix that is a sub string of <code>s1</code>, that will give you the point of rotation. Once you find that point, break <code>s2</code> at that point to get <code>s2a</code> and <code>s2b</code>, then just check if <code>concatenate(s2a,s2b) == s1</code></p>

I more or less fell in love with the way Python permits me to express beautiful solutions and also with the semantics of the language that allows such a natural flow from thoughts to workable code.</p>

<p>What I would like to know is your answer to a kind of question I have seldom seen in this or other forums. This question seems central to me for anyone on the path to Python improvement but who wonders what his next steps should be.</p>

<p>Let me sum up what I do NOT want to ask first ;)</p>

<ul>
<li>I don't want to know how to QUICKLY learn Python</li>
<li>Nor do I want to find out the best way to get acquainted with the language</li>
<li>Finally, I don't want to know a 'one trick that does it all' approach.</li>
</ul>

<p>What I do want to know your opinion about, is:</p>

<p><strong>What are the steps YOU would recommend to a Python journeyman, from apprenticeship to guru status (feel free to stop wherever your expertise dictates it), in order that one IMPROVES CONSTANTLY, becoming a better and better Python coder, one step at a time. Some of the people on SO almost seem worthy of worship for their Python prowess, please enlighten us :)</strong></p>

<p>The kind of answers I would enjoy (but feel free to surprise the readership :P ), is formatted more or less like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Read this (eg: python tutorial), pay attention to that kind of details</li>
<li>Code for so manytime/problems/lines of code</li>
<li>Then, read this (eg: this or that book), but this time, pay attention to this</li>
<li>Tackle a few real-life problems</li>
<li>Then, proceed to reading Y.</li>
<li>Be sure to grasp these concepts</li>
<li>Code for X time</li>
<li>Come back to such and such basics or move further to...</li>
<li>(you get the point :)</li>
</ul>

<p>I really care about knowing your opinion on what exactly one should pay attention to, at various stages, in order to progress CONSTANTLY (with due efforts, of course). If you come from a specific field of expertise, discuss the path you see as appropriate in this field.</p>

<p>However, if I am not wrong, it looks like in the example, the <code>mappedBy</code> is actually specified on the owning side of the association, rather than the non-owning side.</p>

"2602043","<p>We are launching a new REST API and I wanted some community input on best practices around how we should have input parameters formatted:</p>

<p>Right now, our API is very JSON-centric (only returns JSON).  The debate of whether we want/need to return XML is a separate issue.</p>

<p>As our API output is JSON centric, we have been going down a path where our inputs are a bit JSON centric and I've been thinking that may be convenient for some but weird in general.</p>

<p>For example, to get a few product details where multiple products can be pulled at once we currently have:</p>

<pre><code>http://our.api.com/Product?id=[""101404"",""7267261""]
</code></pre>

<p>Should we simplify this as:</p>

<pre><code>http://our.api.com/Product?id=101404,7267261
</code></pre>

<p>Or is having JSON input handy? More of a pain?</p>

<p>We may want to accept both styles but does that flexibility actually cause more confusion and head aches (maintainability, documentation, etc.)?</p>

<p>A more complex case is when we want to offer more complex inputs.  For example, if we want to allow multiple filters on search:</p>

<pre><code>http://our.api.com/Search?term=pumas&amp;filters={""productType"":[""Clothing"",""Bags""],""color"":[""Black"",""Red""]}
</code></pre>

<p>We don't necessarily want to put the filter types (e.g. productType and color) as request names like this:</p>

<pre><code>http://our.api.com/Search?term=pumas&amp;productType=[""Clothing"",""Bags""]&amp;color=[""Black"",""Red""]
</code></pre>

<p>Because we wanted to group all filter input together.</p>

<p>In the end, does this really matter?  It may be likely that there are so many JSON utils out there that the input type just doesn't matter that much.</p>

"2619598","<p>What is the difference between <code>dependencyManagement</code> and <code>dependencies</code>?
I have seen the docs at Apache Maven web site.
It seems that a dependency defined under the <code>dependencyManagement</code> can be used in its child modules without specifying the version. </p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>A parent project (Pro-par) defines a dependency under the <code>dependencyManagement</code>:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;dependencyManagement&gt;
  &lt;dependencies&gt;
    &lt;dependency&gt;
      &lt;groupId&gt;junit&lt;/groupId&gt;

    &lt;/dependency&gt;
 &lt;/dependencies&gt;
&lt;/dependencyManagement&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Then in the child of Pro-par, I can use the junit:</p>

<pre><code>  &lt;dependencies&gt;
    &lt;dependency&gt;
      &lt;groupId&gt;junit&lt;/groupId&gt;
      &lt;artifactId&gt;junit&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;/dependency&gt;
 &lt;/dependencies&gt;

<li><p><strong>Workflows / branching models</strong></p>

<p>Below are the three main descriptions of this I have seen, but they are partially contradicting each other or don't go far enough to sort out the subsequent issues we've run into (as described below). Thus our team so far defaults to not so great solutions. Are you doing something better? </p>

</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Merging vs rebasing (tangled vs sequential history)</strong> </p>

<p>Should one <code>pull --rebase</code> or wait with merging back to the mainline until your task is finished? Personally I lean towards merging since this preserves a visual illustration of on which base a task was started and finished, and I even prefer <code>merge --no-ff</code> for this purpose. It has other drawbacks however. Also many haven't realized the useful property of merging - that it isn't <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutativity"" rel=""noreferrer"">commutative</a> (merging a topic branch into master does not mean merging master into the topic branch).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>I am looking for a natural workflow</strong> </p>

<p>Sometimes mistakes happen because our procedures don't capture a specific situation with simple rules. For example a fix needed for earlier releases should of course be based sufficiently downstream to be possible to merge upstream into all branches necessary (is the usage of these terms clear enough?). However it happens that a fix makes it into the master before the developer realizes it should have been placed further downstream, and if that is already pushed (even worse, merged or something based on it) then the option remaining is cherry-picking, with its associated perils. What simple rules like such do you use? <em>Also in this is included the awkwardness of one topic branch necessarily excluding other topic branches (assuming they are branched from a common baseline). Developers don't want to finish a feature to start another one feeling like the code they just wrote is not there anymore</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>How to avoid creating merge conflicts (due to cherry-pick)?</strong> </p>

<p>What seems like a sure way to create a merge conflict is to cherry-pick between branches, they can never be merged again? Would applying the same commit in revert (how to do this?) in either branch possibly solve this situation? This is one reason I do not dare to push for a largely merge-based workflow.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>How to decompose into topical branches?</strong> </p>

<p>We realize that it would be awesome to assemble a finished integration from topic branches, but often work by our developers is not clearly defined (sometimes as simple as ""poking around"") and if some code has already gone into a ""misc"" topic, it can not be taken out of there again, according to the question above? How do you work with defining/approving/graduating/releasing your topic branches?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Proper procedures like code review and graduating</strong> would of course be lovely. </p>

<p>But we simply cannot keep things untangled enough to manage this - any suggestions?
integration branches, illustrations?</p></li>

Git will recognise the file from the contents, rather than seeing it as a new untracked file, and keep the change history.</p>

<p>However, doing just this tonight I ended up reverting to <code>git mv</code>.</p>

<pre><code>&gt; $ git status
# On branch master
# Changes to be committed:
#   (use ""git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;..."" to unstage)
#
#   modified:   index.html
#

<p>Rename my stylesheet in Finder from <code>iphone.css</code> to <code>mobile.css</code></p>

<pre><code>&gt; $ git status
# On branch master
# Changes to be committed:
#   (use ""git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;..."" to unstage)
#
#   modified:   index.html
#
# Changed but not updated:
#   (use ""git add/rm &lt;file&gt;..."" to update what will be committed)
#   (use ""git checkout -- &lt;file&gt;..."" to discard changes in working directory)
#
#   deleted:    css/iphone.css
#
# Untracked files:
#   (use ""git add &lt;file&gt;..."" to include in what will be committed)
#
#   css/mobile.css
</code></pre>

<p>So git now thinks I've deleted one CSS file, and added a new one. Not what I want, lets undo the rename and let git do the work.</p>

<pre><code>&gt; $ git reset HEAD .
Unstaged changes after reset:
M   css/iphone.css
M   index.html
</code></pre>

<p>Back to where I began.</p>

<pre><code>&gt; $ git status
# On branch master
# Changes to be committed:
#   (use ""git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;..."" to unstage)
#
#   modified:   index.html
#
</code></pre>

<p>Lets use <code>git mv</code> instead.</p>

<pre><code>&gt; $ git mv css/iphone.css css/mobile.css
&gt; $ git status
# On branch master
# Changes to be committed:
#   (use ""git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;..."" to unstage)
#
#   renamed:    css/iphone.css -&gt; css/mobile.css
#
# Changed but not updated:
#   (use ""git add &lt;file&gt;..."" to update what will be committed)
#   (use ""git checkout -- &lt;file&gt;..."" to discard changes in working directory)
#

"2646028","<p>I have a ScrollView that surrounds my entire layout so that the entire screen is scrollable.  The first element I have in this ScrollView is a HorizontalScrollView block that has features that can be scrolled through horizontally.  I've added an ontouchlistener to the horizontalscrollview to handle touch events and force the view to ""snap"" to the closest image on the ACTION_UP event.</p>

<p>So the effect I'm going for is like the stock android homescreen where you can scroll from one to the other and it snaps to one screen when you lift your finger.</p>

<p>This all works great except for one problem:  I need to swipe left to right almost perfectly horizontally for an ACTION_UP to ever register.  If I swipe vertically in the very least (which I think many people tend to do on their phones when swiping side to side), I will receive an ACTION_CANCEL instead of an ACTION_UP.  My theory is that this is because the horizontalscrollview is within a scrollview, and the scrollview is hijacking the vertical touch to allow for vertical scrolling.  </p>

<p>How can I disable the touch events for the scrollview from just within my horizontal scrollview, but still allow for normal vertical scrolling elsewhere in the scrollview?</p>

"2664885","<p>Xcode 3.2 provides an awesome new feature under the Build menu, ""Build and Archive"" which generates an .ipa file suitable for Ad Hoc distribution.  You can also open the Organizer, go to ""Archived Applications,"" and ""Submit Application to iTunesConnect.""</p>

<p>Is there a way to use ""Build and Archive"" from the command line (as part of a build script)?  I'd assume that <code>xcodebuild</code> would be involved somehow, but the <code>man</code> page doesn't seem to say anything about this.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong> Michael Grinich requested clarification; here's what exactly you can't do with command-line builds, features you can ONLY do with Xcode's Organizer after you ""Build and Archive.""</p>

<ol>
<li>You can click ""Share Application..."" to share your IPA with beta testers.  As Guillaume points out below, due to some Xcode magic, this IPA file does not require a separately distributed .mobileprovision file that beta testers need to install; that's magical. No command-line script can do it.  For example, Arrix's script (submitted May 1) does not meet that requirement.</li>
<li>More importantly, after you've beta tested a build, you can click ""Submit Application to iTunes Connect"" to submit that EXACT same build to Apple, the very binary you tested, without rebuilding it. That's impossible from the command line, because signing the app is part of the build process; you can sign bits for Ad Hoc beta testing OR you can sign them for submission to the App Store, but not both.  No IPA built on the command-line can be beta tested on phones and then submitted directly to Apple.</li>
</ol>

<p>I'd love for someone to come along and prove me wrong: both of these features work great in the Xcode GUI and cannot be replicated from the command line.</p>

I'm no expert yet, but I've already begun to find it easier to reason ""functionally"" than imperatively for basic algorithms (and I'm having trouble going back where I have to).  </p>

<p>The one area where current FP seems to fall flat, however, is GUI programming.  The Haskell approach seems to be to just wrap imperative GUI toolkits (such as GTK+ or wxWidgets) and to use ""do"" blocks to simulate an imperative style.  I haven't used F#, but my understanding is that it does something similar using OOP with .NET classes.  Obviously, there's a good reason for this--current GUI programming is all about IO and side effects, so purely functional programming isn't possible with most current frameworks.  </p>

<p>My question is, is it possible to have a functional approach to GUI programming?  I'm having trouble imagining what this would look like in practice.  Does anyone know of any frameworks, experimental or otherwise, that try this sort of thing (or even any frameworks that are designed from the ground up for a functional language)?  Or is the solution to just use a hybrid approach, with OOP for the GUI parts and FP for the logic?

"2684364","<p>It seems to be a mainstream opinion that assembly programming takes longer and is more difficult to program in than a higher level language such as C. Therefore it seems to be recommend or assumed that it is better to write in a higher level language for these reasons and for the reason of better portability.</p>

<p>Recently I've been writing in x86 assembly and it has dawned on me that perhaps these reasons are not really true, except perhaps portability. Perhaps it is more of a matter of familiarity and knowing how to write assembly well. I also noticed that programming in assembly is quite different than programming in an HLL. Perhaps a good and experienced assembly programmer could write programs just as easily and as quickly as an experienced C programmer writing in C.</p>

<p>Perhaps it is because assembly programming is quite different than HLLs, and so requires different thinking, methods and ways, which makes it seem very awkward to program in for the unfamiliar, and so gives it its bad name for writing programs in.</p>

<p>If portability isn't an issue, then really, what would C have over a good assembler such as NASM?</p>

<p><b>Edit:</b>
Just to point out. When you are writing in assembly, you don't have to write just in instruction codes. You can use macros and procedures and your own conventions to make various abstractions to make programs more modular, more maintainable and easier to read. This is where being familiar with how to write good assembly comes in.</p>

<p>From <a href=""https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/0596518188"" rel=""noreferrer"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Erlang Programming</a> (2009):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Erlang concurrency is fast and scalable. Its processes are lightweight in that the Erlang virtual machine does not create an OS thread for every created process. They are created, scheduled, and handled in the VM, independent of underlying operating system. As a result, process creation time is of the order of microseconds and independent of the number of concurrently existing processes. Compare this with Java and C#, where for every process an underlying OS thread is created: you will get some very competitive comparisons, with Erlang greatly outperforming both languages.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From <a href=""http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.116.1969&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf"" rel=""noreferrer""> Concurrency oriented programming in Erlang (pdf)</a> <a href=""http://www.scribd.com/doc/6505089/Concurrency-Oriented-Programming-in-Erlang-by-Joe-Armstrong"" rel=""noreferrer"">(slides)</a> (2003):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We observe that the time taken to create an Erlang process is constant 1µs up to 2,500 processes; thereafter it increases to about 3µs for up to 30,000 processes. The performance of Java and C# is shown at the top of the figure. For a small number of processes it takes about 300µs to create a process. Creating more than two thousand processes is impossible.</p>
<p>We see that for up to 30,000 processes the time to send a message between two Erlang processes is about 0.8µs. For C# it takes about 50µs per message, up to the maximum number of processes (which was about 1800 processes). Java was even worse, for up to 100 process it took about 50µs per message thereafter it increased rapidly to 10ms per message when there were about 1000 Java processes.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>My thoughts</h2>
<p>I don't fully understand technically why Erlang processes are so much more efficient in spawning new processes and have much smaller memory footprints per process. Both the OS and Erlang VM have to do scheduling, context switches, and keep track of the values in the registers and so on...</p>
<p>Simply why aren't OS threads implemented in the same way as processes in Erlang? Do they have to support something more? And why do they need a bigger memory footprint? And why do they have slower spawning and communication?</p>
<p>Technically, why are processes in Erlang more efficient than OS threads when it comes to spawning and communication? And why can't threads in the OS be implemented and managed in the same efficient way? And why do OS threads have a bigger memory footprint, plus slower spawning and communication?</p>

<p>However, I'm evaluating whether adopting a version control system such as git would be worthwhile.</p>

<p><b>A brief overview:</b>
I'm a social scientist who uses R to analyse data for research publications.
I don't currently produce R packages.
My R code for a project typically includes a few thousand lines of code for data input, cleaning, manipulation, analyses, and output generation.
Publications are typically written using LaTeX.</p>

<p>With regards to version control there are many benefits which I have read about, yet they seem to be less relevant to the solo data analyst.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Backup:</b> I have a backup system already in place. </li>
<li><b>Forking and rewinding:</b> I've never felt the need to do this, 
   but I can see how it could be useful (e.g., you are preparing multiple 
  journal articles based on the same dataset; you are preparing a report 
  that is updated monthly, etc)</li>
<li><b>Collaboration:</b> Most of the time I am
analysing data myself, thus, I
wouldn't get the collaboration
benefits of version control.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are also several potential costs involved with adopting version control:</p>

<ul>
<li>Time to evaluate and learn a version control system</li>
<li>A possible increase in complexity over my current file management system</li>
</ul>

<p>However, I still have the feeling that I'm missing something.
General guides on version control seem to be addressed more towards computer scientists than data analysts.</p>

<p>Thus, specifically <b>in relation to data analysts</b> in circumstances similar to those listed above:</p>

<li>Is version control worth the effort?</li>
<li>What are the main pros and cons of adopting version control? </li>

<p>So suppose I have a method <code>doSomething(List&lt;Animal&gt; animals)</code>.

"2768104","<p>A repeating theme in my development work has been the use of or creation of an in-house plug-in architecture.  I've seen it approached many ways - configuration files (XML, .conf, and so on), inheritance frameworks, database information, libraries, and others.  In my experience:</p>

<ul>
<li>A database isn't a great place to store your configuration information, especially co-mingled with data</li>
<li>Attempting this with an inheritance hierarchy requires knowledge about the plug-ins to be coded in, meaning the plug-in architecture isn't all that dynamic</li>
<li>Configuration files work well for providing simple information, but can't handle more complex behaviors</li>
<li>Libraries seem to work well, but the one-way dependencies have to be carefully created.</li>
</ul>

<p>As I seek to learn from the various architectures I've worked with, I'm also looking to the community for suggestions.  How have you implemented a SOLID plug-in architecture?  What was your worst failure (or the worst failure you've seen)?  What would you do if you were going to implement a new plug-in architecture?  What SDK or open source project that you've worked with has the best example of a good architecture?</p>

What is the fastest way to sort an array of 6 integers?</p>

<p>As the question is very low level:</p>

<ul>
<li>we can't assume libraries are available (and the call itself has its cost), only plain C</li>
<li>to avoid emptying instruction pipeline (that has a <em>very</em> high cost) we should probably minimize branches, jumps, and every other kind of control flow breaking (like those hidden behind sequence points in <code>&amp;&amp;</code> or <code>||</code>).</li>
<li>room is constrained and minimizing registers and memory use is an issue, ideally in place sort is probably best.</li>
</ul>

<p>Really this question is a kind of Golf where the goal is not to minimize source length but execution time. I call it 'Zening' code as used in the title of the book <a href=""https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/1883577039"" rel=""noreferrer"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Zen of Code optimization</a> by <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Abrash"" rel=""noreferrer"">Michael Abrash</a> and its <a href=""http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2008/02/there-aint-no-such-thing-as-the-fastest-code.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">sequels</a>.</p>

<p>As for why it is interesting, there is several layers:</p>

<ul>
<li>the example is simple and easy to understand and measure, not much C skill involved</li>
<li>it shows effects of choice of a good algorithm for the problem, but also effects of the compiler and underlying hardware.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is my reference (naive, not optimized) implementation and my test set.</p>

<h2><strong>Comments on proposed solutions</strong></h2>

<p><strong>Insertion Sort (Daniel Stutzbach)</strong></p>

<p>As expected minimizing branches is indeed a good idea.</p>

<p><strong>Sorting Networks (Daniel Stutzbach)</strong></p>

<p>Better than insertion sort. I wondered if the main effect was not get from avoiding the external loop. I gave it a try by unrolled insertion sort to check and indeed we get roughly the same figures (code is <a href=""http://pastebin.com/azzuk072"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Sorting Networks (Paul R)</strong></p>

<p>The best so far. The actual code I used to test is <a href=""http://pastebin.com/azzuk072"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a>. Don't know yet why it is nearly two times as fast as the other sorting network implementation. Parameter passing ? Fast max ?</p>

<p><strong>Sorting Networks 12 SWAP with Fast Swap</strong></p>

<p>As suggested by Daniel Stutzbach, I combined his 12 swap sorting network with branchless fast swap (code is <a href=""http://pastebin.com/azzuk072"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a>). It is indeed faster, the best so far with a small margin (roughly 5%) as could be expected using 1 less swap. </p>

<p>It is also interesting to notice that the branchless swap seems to be much (4 times) less efficient than the simple one using if on PPC architecture.</p>

<p><strong>Calling Library qsort</strong></p>

<p>To give another reference point I also tried as suggested to just call library qsort (code is <a href=""http://pastebin.com/azzuk072"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a>). As expected it is much slower : 10 to 30 times slower...  as it became obvious with the new test suite, the main problem seems to be the initial load of the library after the first call, and it compares not so poorly with other version. It is just between 3 and 20 times slower on my Linux. On some architecture used for tests by others it seems even to be faster (I'm really surprised by that one, as library qsort use a more complex API).</p>

<p><strong>Rank order</strong></p>

<p>Rex Kerr proposed another completely different method : for each item of the array compute directly its final position. This is efficient because computing rank order do not need branch. The drawback of this method is that it takes three times the amount of memory of the array (one copy of array and variables to store rank orders). The performance results are very surprising (and interesting). On my reference architecture with 32 bits OS and Intel Core2 Quad E8300, cycle count was slightly below 1000 (like sorting networks with branching swap). But when compiled and executed on my 64 bits box (Intel Core2 Duo) it performed much better : it became the fastest so far. I finally found out the true reason. My 32bits box use gcc 4.4.1 and my 64bits box gcc 4.4.3 and the last one seems much better at optimizing this particular code (there was very little difference for other proposals).</p>

<p><em>update</em>:</p>

<p>As published figures above shows this effect was still enhanced by later versions of gcc and Rank Order became consistently twice as fast as any other alternative.</p>

<p><strong>Sorting Networks 12 with reordered Swap</strong></p>

<p>The amazing efficiency of the Rex Kerr proposal with gcc 4.4.3 made me wonder : how could a program with 3 times as much memory usage be faster than branchless sorting networks? My hypothesis was that it had less dependencies of the kind read after write, allowing for better use of the superscalar instruction scheduler of the x86. That gave me an idea: reorder swaps to minimize read after write dependencies. More simply put: when you do <code>SWAP(1, 2); SWAP(0, 2);</code> you have to wait for the first swap to be finished before performing the second one because both access to a common memory cell. When you do <code>SWAP(1, 2); SWAP(4, 5);</code>the processor can execute both in parallel. I tried it and it works as expected, the sorting networks is running about 10% faster. </p>

<p><strong>Sorting Networks 12 with Simple Swap</strong></p>

<p>One year after the original post Steinar H. Gunderson suggested, that we should not try to outsmart the compiler and keep the swap code simple. It's indeed a good idea as the resulting code is about 40% faster! He also proposed a swap optimized by hand using x86 inline assembly code that can still spare some more cycles. The most surprising (it says volumes on programmer's psychology) is that one year ago none of used tried that version of swap. Code I used to test is <a href=""http://pastebin.com/azzuk072"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a>. Others suggested other ways to write a C fast swap, but it yields the same performances as the simple one with a decent compiler.</p>

<p>The ""best"" code is now as follow:</p>

<pre><code>static inline void sort6_sorting_network_simple_swap(int * d){
#define min(x, y) (x&lt;y?x:y)
#define max(x, y) (x&lt;y?y:x) 
#define SWAP(x,y) { const int a = min(d[x], d[y]); \
                    const int b = max(d[x], d[y]); \
                    d[x] = a; d[y] = b; }
    SWAP(1, 2);
    SWAP(4, 5);
    SWAP(0, 2);
    SWAP(3, 5);
    SWAP(0, 1);
    SWAP(3, 4);
    SWAP(1, 4);
    SWAP(0, 3);
    SWAP(2, 5);
    SWAP(1, 3);
    SWAP(2, 4);
    SWAP(2, 3);
#undef SWAP
#undef min
#undef max
}
</code></pre>

<p>If we believe our test set (and, yes it is quite poor, it's mere benefit is being short, simple and easy to understand what we are measuring), the average number of cycles of the resulting code for one sort is below 40 cycles (6 tests are executed). That put each swap at an average of 4 cycles. I call that amazingly fast. Any other improvements possible ?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A computer program or routine is
  described as reentrant if it can be
  <strong><em>safely</em></strong> called again before its
  previous invocation has been completed
  (i.e it can be safely executed
  concurrently). To be reentrant, a
  computer program or routine:</p>
  
  <ol>
  <li>Must hold no static (or global)
  non-constant data.     </li>
  <li>Must not return the address to
  static (or global) non-constant
  data.     </li>
  <li>Must work only on the data provided
  to it by the caller.     </li>
  <li>Must not rely on locks to singleton
  resources.     </li>
  <li>Must not modify its own code (unless
  executing in its own unique thread
  storage)     </li>
  <li>Must not call non-reentrant computer
  programs or routines.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>How is <strong><em>safely</em></strong> defined? </p>

<p>If a program can be <strong><em>safely executed concurrently</em></strong>, does it always mean that it is reentrant?</p>

<p>What exactly is the common thread between the six points mentioned that I should keep in mind while checking my code for reentrant capabilities?</p>

<p>Also,</p>

<ol>
<li>Are all recursive functions reentrant?</li>
<li>Are all thread-safe functions reentrant?</li>
<li>Are all recursive and thread-safe functions reentrant?</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<p>While writing this question, one thing comes to mind:
Are the terms like <strong>reentrance</strong> and <strong>thread safety</strong> absolute at all i.e. do they have fixed concrete definations? For, if they are not, this question is not very meaningful.</p>

But I cannot get this to work properly. Here is what I did so far:</p>

<p>I created a shape like this (mp2.xml)</p>

<p>then created a style (attrs.xml) like this:</p>

<p>and the in my main.xml I have set the style like this:</p>

<p><code>Bob</code>'s columns are factors. So, for example:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; as.character(head(bob))
[1] ""c(3, 3, 3, 6, 6, 6)""       ""c(3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3)""

<p>I don't begin to understand this, but I guess these are indices into the levels of the factors of the columns (of the court of king caractacus) of <code>bob</code>? Not what I need.</p>

<p>Strangely I can go through the columns of <code>bob</code> by hand, and do</p>

<pre><code>bob$phenotype &lt;- as.character(bob$phenotype)
</code></pre>

<p>which works fine. And, after some typing, I can get a data.frame whose columns are characters rather than factors. So my question is: how can I do this automatically? How do I convert a data.frame with factor columns into a data.frame with character columns without having to manually go through each column? </p>

    //
    // Q3: Will this second connection's automatic enlistment
    // in the current transaction scope cause the transaction to be
    // escalated to a distributed transaction? (Yes?)

<h2>Scenario 2: Using connections INSIDE a transaction scope that were opened OUTSIDE of it</h2>

<pre><code>//Assume no ambient transaction active now

<p>Now, I know that I can parse the file, send the result to the server, and have the browser request the file back from the server as a download. But in reality the server has nothing to do with this particular process, so why get it involved? I already have the contents of the desired file in memory. Is there any way that I could present the user with a download using pure JavaScript? (I doubt it, but might as well ask...)</p>

Can someone tell me a little more about these? Perhaps an explanation will come in handy someday when writing a framework :)</p>

<p>What does this do? (I know it extends jQuery somehow but is there anything else interesting to know about this)</p>

<pre><code>(function($) {

})(jQuery);
</code></pre>

<p>What is the difference between the following two ways of writing a plugin:</p>

<p><strong>Type 1:</strong></p>

<pre><code>(function($) {
    $.fn.jPluginName = {

        },

        $.fn.jPluginName.defaults = {

        }
})(jQuery);
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Type 2:</strong></p>

<pre><code>(function($) {
    $.jPluginName = {

        }
})(jQuery);
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Type 3:</strong></p>

<pre><code>(function($){

    //Attach this new method to jQuery
    $.fn.extend({ 

        var defaults = {  
        }  

        var options =  $.extend(defaults, options);  

        //This is where you write your plugin's name
        pluginname: function() {

            //Iterate over the current set of matched elements
            return this.each(function() {

                //code to be inserted here

            });
        }
    }); 
})(jQuery);
</code></pre>

<p>I could be way off here and maybe all mean the same thing. I am confused. In some cases, <strong>this</strong> doesn't seem to be working in a plugin that I was writing using Type 1. So far, Type 3 seems the most elegant to me but I'd like to know about the others as well.</p>

"2938301","<p>I was working with a friend on a project, and he edited a bunch of files that shouldn't have been edited. Somehow I merged his work into mine, either when I pulled it, or when I tried to just pick the specific files out that I wanted. I've been looking and playing for a long time, trying to figure out how to remove the commits that contain the edits to those files, it seems to be a toss up between revert and rebase, and there are no straightforward examples, and the docs assume I know more than I do.</p>

<p>So here is a simplified version of the question:</p>

<p>Given the following scenario, how do I remove commit 2?</p>

<pre><code>$ mkdir git_revert_test &amp;&amp; cd git_revert_test

$ git init

"2971550","<p>Heroku has a policy of ignoring all branches but 'master'.</p>

<p>While I'm sure Heroku's designers have excellent reasons for this policy (I'm guessing for storage and performance optimization), the consequence to me as a developer is that whatever local topic branch I may be working on, I would like an easy way to switch Heroku's master to that local topic branch and do a ""git push heroku -f"" to over-write master on Heroku.</p>

<p>What I got from reading the ""Pushing Refspecs"" section of <a href=""http://progit.org/book/ch9-5.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://progit.org/book/ch9-5.html</a> is</p>

<pre>git push -f heroku local-topic-branch:refs/heads/master</pre>

<p>What I'd really like is a way to set this up in the configuration file so that ""git push heroku"" always does the above, replacing <em>local-topic-branch</em> with the name of whatever my current branch happens to be.  If anyone knows how to accomplish that, please let me know!</p>

<p>The caveat for this, of course, is that this is only sensible if I am the only one who can push to that Heroku app/repository. A test or QA team might manage such a repository to try out different candidate branches, but they would have to coordinate so that they all agree on what branch they are pushing to it on any given day.</p>

<p>Needless to say, it would also be a very good idea to have a separate remote repository (like GitHub) without this restriction for backing everything up to. I'd call that one ""origin"" and use ""heroku"" for Heroku so that ""git push"" always backs up everything to origin, and ""git push heroku"" pushes whatever branch I'm currently on to Heroku's master branch, overwriting it if necessary.</p>

<p>Would this work?</p>

<pre>
[remote ""heroku""]
    url = git@heroku.com:my-app.git
    push = +refs/heads/*:refs/heads/master
</pre>

<p>I'd like to hear from someone more experienced before I begin to experiment, although I suppose I could create a dummy app on Heroku and experiment with that.</p>

<p>As for fetching, I don't really care if the Heroku repository is write-only. I still have a separate repository, like GitHub, for backup and cloning of all my work.</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = '1';

<p>the code runs fine as the ID field is the primary index.
However, for a recent development in the project, I have to search the database by another field. For example:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM table WHERE product_id = '1';

<p>This field was not previously indexed; however, I've added one, so mysql now indexes the field, but when I try to run the above query, it runs very slowly. An EXPLAIN query reveals that there is no index for the product_id field when I've already added one, and as a result the query takes any where from 20 minutes to 30 minutes to return a single row.</p>

<p>My full EXPLAIN results are:</p>

<pre><code>| id | select_type | table | type | possible_keys| key  | key_len | ref  | rows  | Extra       |

"3007998","<p>All activities in my application require a user to be logged-in to view. Users can log out from almost any activity. This is a requirement of the application. At any point if the user logs-out, I want to send the user to the Login <code>Activity</code>. At this point I want this activity to be at the bottom of the history stack so that pressing the ""back"" button returns the user to Android's home screen.</p>

<p>I've seen this question asked a few different places, all answered with similar answers (that I outline here), but I want to pose it here to collect feedback.</p>

<p>I've tried opening the Login activity by setting its <code>Intent</code> flags to <code>FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TOP</code> which seems to do as is outlined in the documentation, but does not achieve my goal of placing the Login activity at the bottom of the history stack, and preventing the user from navigating back to previously-seen logged-in activities. I also tried using <code>android:launchMode=""singleTop""</code> for the Login activity in the manifest, but this does not accomplish my goal either (and seems to have no effect anyway).</p>

<p>I believe I need to either clear the history stack, or finish all previously- opened activities.</p>

<p>One option is to have each activity's <code>onCreate</code> check logged-in status, and <code>finish()</code> if not logged-in. I do not like this option, as the back button will still be available for use, navigating back as activities close themselves.</p>

<p>The next option is to maintain a <code>LinkedList</code> of references to all open activities that is statically accessible from everywhere (perhaps using weak references). On logout I will access this list and iterate over all previously-opened activities, invoking <code>finish()</code> on each one. I'll probably begin implementing this method soon.</p>

<p>I'd rather use some <code>Intent</code> flag trickery to accomplish this, however. I'd be beyond happy to find that I can fulfill my application's requirements without having to use either of the two methods that I've outlined above.</p>

<p>Is there a way to accomplish this by using <code>Intent</code> or manifest settings, or is my second option, maintaining a <code>LinkedList</code> of opened activities the best option? Or is there another option that I'm completely overlooking?</p>

"3077866","<p>What is a good way to design/structure large functional programs, especially in Haskell?</p>

<p>I've been through a bunch of the tutorials (Write Yourself a Scheme being my favorite, with Real World Haskell a close second) - but most of the programs are relatively small, and single-purpose.  Additionally, I don't consider some of them to be particularly elegant (for example, the vast lookup tables in WYAS).</p>

<p>I'm now wanting to write larger programs, with more moving parts - acquiring data from a variety of different sources, cleaning it, processing it in various ways, displaying it in user interfaces, persisting it, communicating over networks, etc.  How could one best structure such code to be legible, maintainable, and adaptable to changing requirements?</p>

<p>There is quite a large literature addressing these questions for large object-oriented imperative programs. Ideas like MVC, design patterns, etc. are decent prescriptions for realizing broad goals like separation of concerns and reusability in an OO style.  Additionally, newer imperative languages lend themselves to a 'design as you grow' style of refactoring to which, in my novice opinion, Haskell appears less well-suited.</p>

<p>Is there an equivalent literature for Haskell?  How is the zoo of exotic control structures available in functional programming (monads, arrows, applicative, etc.) best employed for this purpose? What best practices could you recommend?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>EDIT (this is a follow-up to Don Stewart's answer):</p>

<p>@dons mentioned: ""Monads capture key architectural designs in types.""</p>

<p>I guess my question is: how should one think about key architectural designs in a pure functional language?</p>

<p>Consider the example of several data streams, and several processing steps.  I can write modular parsers for the data streams to a set of data structures, and I can implement each processing step as a pure function.  The processing steps required for one piece of data will depend on its value and others'.  Some of the steps should be followed by side-effects like GUI updates or database queries.</p>

<p>What's the 'Right' way to tie the data and the parsing steps in a nice way?  One could write a big function which does the right thing for the various data types.  Or one could use a monad to keep track of what's been processed so far and have each processing step get whatever it needs next from the monad state.  Or one could write largely separate programs and send messages around (I don't much like this option).</p>

According to wikipedia, REST itself is defined to be <em>Representational State Transfer</em>. I therefore don't understand all this stateless <em>gobbledeygook</em> that everyone keeps spewing.</p>
<p>From wikipedia:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At any particular time, a client can either be in transition between
application states or &quot;at rest&quot;. A client in a rest state is able to
interact with its user, but creates no load and consumes no per-client
storage on the set of servers or on the network.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Are they just saying don't use session/application level data store???</p>
<p>I get that one goal of REST is to make URI access consistent and available, for instance, instead of hiding paging requests inside posts, making the page number of a request a part of the GET URI.  Makes sense to me. But it seems like it is just going overboard saying that <em>no per client data</em> (session data) should ever be stored server side.</p>
<p>What if I had a queue of messages, and my user wanted to read the messages, but as he read them, wanted to block certain senders messages coming through for the duration of his session? Wouldn't it make sense to store this in a place on the server side, and have the server only send messages (or message ID's) that were not blocked by the user?</p>
<p>Do I really have to send the entire list of message senders to block each time I request the new message list? The message list pertinent to me wouldn't/shouldn't even be a publicly available resource in the first place..</p>

Rather, I'd like to have a <code>grep</code>-able list of <em>red-flag</em> keywords handy when searching a compromised server for back-doors.</p>

<p>The idea is that if you want to build a multi-purpose malicious PHP script -- such as a ""web shell"" script like c99 or r57 -- you're going to have to use one or more of a relatively small set of functions somewhere in the file in order to allow the user to execute arbitrary code.

&lt;? system($_GET['cmd']); ?&gt;

&lt;? preg_replace('/.*/e',$_POST['code']); ?&gt;

<p>and so forth. </p>

<p>Searching through a compromised website the other day, I didn't notice a piece of malicious code because I didn't realize <code>preg_replace</code> could be made dangerous by the use of the <code>/e</code> flag (<em>which, seriously?

<p>In response to it being for security purposes:</p>

<p>If the scraper is on another domain they would have to use a <code>script</code> tag to get the data because XHR won't work cross-domain. Even without the <code>for(;;);</code> how would the attacker get the data? It's not assigned to a variable so wouldn't it just be garbage collected because there's no references to it?</p>

<p>But even without the crash script prepended the attacker can't use any of the Json data without it being assigned to a variable that you can access globally (it isn't in these cases). The crash code effectivly does nothing because even without it they have to use server sided scripting to use the data on their site. </p>

"3183582","<p>OK, so I don't sound like an idiot I'm going to state the problem/requirements more explicitly:</p>

<ul>
<li>Needle (pattern) and haystack (text to search) are both C-style null-terminated strings. No length information is provided; if needed, it must be computed.</li>
<li>Function should return a pointer to the first match, or <code>NULL</code> if no match is found.</li>
<li><strong>Failure cases are not allowed. This means any algorithm with non-constant (or large constant) storage requirements will need to have a fallback case for allocation failure (and performance in the fallback care thereby contributes to worst-case performance).</strong></li>
<li>Implementation is to be in C, although a good description of the algorithm (or link to such) without code is fine too.</li>
</ul>

<p>...as well as what I mean by ""fastest"":</p>

<ul>
<li>Deterministic <code>O(n)</code> where <code>n</code> = haystack length. (But it may be possible to use ideas from algorithms which are normally <code>O(nm)</code> (for example rolling hash) if they're combined with a more robust algorithm to give deterministic <code>O(n)</code> results).</li>
<li>Never performs (measurably; a couple clocks for <code>if (!needle[1])</code> etc. are okay) worse than the naive brute force algorithm, especially on very short needles which are likely the most common case. (Unconditional heavy preprocessing overhead is bad, as is trying to improve the linear coefficient for pathological needles at the expense of likely needles.)</li>
<li>Given an arbitrary needle and haystack, comparable or better performance (no worse than 50% longer search time) versus any other widely-implemented algorithm.</li>
<li>Aside from these conditions, I'm leaving the definition of ""fastest"" open-ended. A good answer should explain why you consider the approach you're suggesting ""fastest"".</li>
</ul>

<p>My current implementation runs in roughly between 10% slower and 8 times faster (depending on the input) than glibc's implementation of Two-Way.</p>

<p><strong>Update: My current optimal algorithm is as follows:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>For needles of length 1, use <code>strchr</code>.</li>
<li>For needles of length 2-4, use machine words to compare 2-4 bytes at once as follows: Preload needle in a 16- or 32-bit integer with bitshifts and cycle old byte out/new bytes in from the haystack at each iteration. Every byte of the haystack is read exactly once and incurs a check against 0 (end of string) and one 16- or 32-bit comparison.</li>
<li>For needles of length >4, use Two-Way algorithm with a bad shift table (like Boyer-Moore) which is applied only to the last byte of the window. To avoid the overhead of initializing a 1kb table, which would be a net loss for many moderate-length needles, I keep a bit array (32 bytes) marking which entries in the shift table are initialized. Bits that are unset correspond to byte values which never appear in the needle, for which a full-needle-length shift is possible.</li>
</ul>

<p>The big questions left in my mind are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is there a way to make better use of the bad shift table? Boyer-Moore makes best use of it by scanning backwards (right-to-left) but Two-Way requires a left-to-right scan.</li>
<li>The only two viable candidate algorithms I've found for the general case (no out-of-memory or quadratic performance conditions) are <a href=""http://www-igm.univ-mlv.fr/~lecroq/string/node26.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Two-Way</a> and <a href=""http://www-igm.univ-mlv.fr/~lecroq/string/node27.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">String Matching on Ordered Alphabets</a>. But are there easily-detectable cases where different algorithms would be optimal? Certainly many of the <code>O(m)</code> (where <code>m</code> is needle length) in space algorithms could be used for <code>m&lt;100</code> or so. It would also be possible to use algorithms which are worst-case quadratic if there's an easy test for needles which provably require only linear time.</li>
</ul>

<p>Bonus points for:</p>

<ul>
<li>Can you improve performance by assuming the needle and haystack are both well-formed UTF-8? (With characters of varying byte lengths, well-formed-ness imposes some string alignment requirements between the needle and haystack and allows automatic 2-4 byte shifts when a mismatching head byte is encountered. But do these constraints buy you much/anything beyond what maximal suffix computations, good suffix shifts, etc. already give you with various algorithms?)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> I'm well aware of most of the algorithms out there, just not how well they perform in practice.

"3197335","<p>I'm looking to make a service which I can use to make calls to a web-based REST API.</p>

<p>Basically I want to start a service on app init then I want to be able to ask that service to request a url and return the results.  In the meantime I want to be able to display a progress window or something similar.</p>

<p>I've created a service currently which uses IDL, I've read somewhere that you only really need this for cross app communication, so think these needs stripping out but unsure how to do callbacks without it.  Also when I hit the <code>post(Config.getURL(""login""), values)</code> the app seems to pause for a while (seems weird - thought the idea behind a service was that it runs on a different thread!)</p>

<p>Currently I have a service with post and get http methods inside, a couple of AIDL files (for two way communication), a ServiceManager which deals with starting, stopping, binding etc to the service and I'm dynamically creating a Handler with specific code for the callbacks as needed.</p>

"3206843","<p>I've read a lot of different questions and answers on Stack Overflow as well as <strong>git</strong> documentation on how the <strong>core.autocrlf</strong> setting works.</p>

<p>This is my understanding from what I've read:</p>

<p>Unix and Mac OSX (pre-OSX uses CR) clients use LF line endings.<br>
Windows clients use CRLF line endings.</p>

<p>When core.autocrlf is set to true on the client, the git repository always stores files in LF line ending format and line endings in files on the client are converted back and forth on check out / commit for clients (i.e. Windows) that use non-LF line endings, no matter what format the line endings files are on the client (this disagrees with Tim Clem's definition - see update below).</p>

<p>Here is a matrix that tries to document the same for the 'input' and 'false' settings of core.autocrlf with question marks where I'm not sure of line ending conversion behavior.</p>

<p>My questions are:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>What should the question marks be?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Is this matrix correct for the ""non-question marks""?</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>I'll update the question marks from the answers as consensus appears to be formed.</p>

commit   |  convert to        ?                 no 
existing |  LF         (convert to LF?)     conversion

checkout |  convert to        ?                 no
existing |  CRLF       (no conversion?)     conversion

</pre>

<p>I'm not really looking for opinions on the pros and cons of the various settings.  I'm just looking for data which makes it clear how to expect git to operate with each of the three settings.</p>

<p>--</p>

<p><strong>Update 04/17/2012</strong>: After reading <a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/20150912185006/http://adaptivepatchwork.com:80/2012/03/01/mind-the-end-of-your-line/"" rel=""noreferrer"">the article by Tim Clem</a> linked by JJD in the comments, I have modified some of the values in the ""unknown"" values in the table above, as well as changing ""checkout existing | true to convert to CRLF instead of convert to client"".  Here are the definitions he gives, which are more clear than anything I've seen elsewhere:</p>

<p><strong>core.autocrlf = false</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is the default, but most people are encouraged to change this
  immediately. The result of using false is that Git doesn’t ever mess
  with line endings on your file. You can check in files with LF or CRLF
  or CR or some random mix of those three and Git does not care. This
  can make diffs harder to read and merges more difficult. Most people
  working in a Unix/Linux world use this value because they don’t have
  CRLF problems and they don’t need Git to be doing extra work whenever
  files are written to the object database or written out into the
  working directory.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>core.autocrlf = true</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This means that Git will process all text files and make sure that
  CRLF is replaced with LF when writing that file to the object database
  and turn all LF back into CRLF when writing out into the working
  directory. This is the recommended setting on Windows because it
  ensures that your repository can be used on other platforms while
  retaining CRLF in your working directory.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>core.autocrlf = input</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This means that Git will process all text files and make sure that
  CRLF is replaced with LF when writing that file to the object
  database. It will not, however, do the reverse. When you read files
  back out of the object database and write them into the working
  directory they will still have LFs to denote the end of line. This
  setting is generally used on Unix/Linux/OS X to prevent CRLFs from
  getting written into the repository. The idea being that if you pasted
  code from a web browser and accidentally got CRLFs into one of your
  files, Git would make sure they were replaced with LFs when you wrote
  to the object database.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Tim's article is excellent, the only thing I can think of that is missing is that he assumes the repository is in LF format, which is not necessarily true, especially for Windows only projects.</p>

<p>Comparing Tim's article to the highest voted answer to date by jmlane shows perfect agreement on the true and input settings and disagreement on the false setting.</p>

"3215029","<p>With the NoSQL movement growing based on document-based databases, I've looked at MongoDB lately.  I have noticed a striking similarity with how to treat items as ""Documents"", just like Lucene does (and users of Solr).</p>

<p>So, the question: <strong>Why would you want to use NoSQL (MongoDB, Cassandra, CouchDB, etc) over Lucene (or Solr) as your ""database""?</strong></p>

<p>What I am (and I am sure others are) looking for in an answer is some deep-dive comparisons of them.  Let's skip over relational database discussions all together, as they serve a different purpose. </p>

<p>Lucene gives some serious advantages, such as powerful searching and weight systems.  Not to mention facets in Solr (which Solr is being integrated into Lucene soon, yay!).  You can use Lucene documents to store IDs, and access the documents as such just like MongoDB.  Mix it with Solr, and you now get a WebService-based, load balanced solution.</p>

<p>You can even throw in a comparison of out-of-proc cache providers such as Velocity or MemCached when talking about similar data storing and scalability of MongoDB.</p>

<p>The restrictions around MongoDB reminds me of using MemCached, but I can use Microsoft's Velocity and have more grouping and list collection power over MongoDB (I think).  Can't get any faster or scalable than caching data in memory.  Even Lucene has a memory provider.</p>

<p>MongoDB (and others) do have some advantages, such as the ease of use of their API.  New up a document, create an id, and store it.  Done.  Nice and easy.</p>

<p>This is a huge task, mostly because of the number of classes to test but also because writing tests is all new to me.</p>

<p>I've already written tests for a bunch of classes, but now I'm wondering if I'm doing it right.  </p>

<p>When I'm writing tests for a method, I have the feeling of rewriting a second time what I already wrote in the method itself.<br>
My tests just seems so tightly bound to the method (testing all codepath, expecting some inner methods to be called a number of times, with certain arguments), that it seems that if I ever refactor the method, the tests will fail even if the final behavior of the method did not change.</p>

<p>This is just a feeling, and as said earlier, I have no experience of testing. If some more experienced testers out there could give me advices on how to write great tests for an existing app, that would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>""You have been asked to design some software to continuously display the top 10 search terms on Google. You are given access to a feed that provides an endless real-time stream of search terms currently being searched on Google. Describe what algorithm and data structures you would use to implement this. You are to design two variations: </p>

<p>(i) Display the top 10 search terms of all time (i.e. since you started reading the feed). </p>

<p>(ii) Display only the top 10 search terms for the past month, updated hourly. </p>

<p>You can use an approximation to obtain the top 10 list, but you must justify your choices.""
<br />I bombed in this interview and still have really no idea how to implement this. </p>

<p>The first part asks for the 10 most frequent items in a continuously growing sub-sequence of an infinite list. I looked into selection algorithms, but couldn't find any online versions to solve this problem. </p>

<p>The second part uses a finite list, but due to the large amount of data being processed, you can't really store the whole month of search terms in memory and calculate a histogram every hour. </p>

<p>The problem is made more difficult by the fact that the top 10 list is being continuously updated, so somehow you need to be calculating your top 10 over a sliding window.</p>

The Prepared Statement may be parametrized </p>

<p>Most relational databases handles a JDBC / SQL query in four steps:  </p>

<p>A Statement will always proceed through the four steps above for each SQL query sent to the database. A Prepared Statement pre-executes steps (1) - (3) in the execution process above. Thus, when creating a Prepared Statement some pre-optimization is performed immediately. The effect is to lessen the load on the database engine at execution time.  </p>

<pre><code>--Get Number of Divisors of n

numDivs n = toInteger $ length [ x | x&lt;-[2.. ((n `quot` 2)+1)], n `rem` x == 0] + 2

triaList =  [foldr (+) 0 [1..n] | n &lt;- [1..]]

--The same recursive
triaList2 = go 0 1
  where go cs n = (cs+n):go (cs+n) (n+1)

--Finds the first triangular Value with more than n Divisors
sol :: Integer -&gt; Integer
sol n = head $ filter (\x -&gt; numDivs(x)&gt;n) triaList2

<p>This Solution for <code>n=500</code> <code>(sol 500)</code> is extremely slow (running for more than 2 hours now), so I wondered how to find out why this solution is so slow. Are there any commands that tell me where most of the computation-time is spent so I know which part of my haskell-program is slow? Something like a simple profiler.</p>

<p>To make it clear, I'm not asking <strong>for</strong> a faster solution but for <strong>a way</strong> to find this solution. How would you start if you would have no haskell knowledge?</p>

"3285704","<p>I've implemented two REST services: Twitter and Netflix. Both times, I struggled to find the use and logic involved in the decision to expose these services as REST instead of SOAP. I hope somebody can clue me in to what I'm missing and explain why REST was used as the service implementation for services such as these.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Implementing a REST service takes infinitely longer than implementing a SOAP service. Tools exist for all modern languages/frameworks/platforms to read in a WSDL and output proxy classes and clients. Implementing a REST service is done by hand and - get this - by reading documentation. Furthermore, while implementing these two services, you have to make ""guesses"" as to what will come back across the pipe as there is no real schema or reference document.</p></li>
<li><p>Why write a REST service that returns XML anyway? The only difference is that with REST you don't know the types each element/attribute represents - you are on your own to implement it and <em>hope</em> that one day a string doesn't come across in a field you thought was always an int. SOAP defines the data structure using the WSDL so this is a no-brainer.</p></li>
<li><p>I've heard the complaint that with SOAP you have the ""overhead"" of the SOAP Envelope. In this day and age, do we really need to worry about a handful of bytes?</p></li>
<li><p>I've heard the argument that with REST you can just pop the URL into the browser and see the data. Sure, if your REST service is using simple or no authentication. The Netflix service, for instance, uses OAuth which requires you to sign things and encode things before you can even submit your request.</p></li>
<li><p>Why do we need a ""readable"" URL for each resource? If we were using a tool to implement the service, do we really care about the actual URL?</p></li>

"3331527","<p>I have a large bitmap (say 3888x2592) in a file. Now, I want to resize that bitmap to 800x533 and save it to another file.
I normally would scale the bitmap by calling <code>Bitmap.createBitmap</code> method but it needs a source bitmap as the first argument, which I can't provide because loading the original image into a Bitmap object would of course exceed the memory (see <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/477572/android-strange-out-of-memory-issue"">here</a>, for example).</p>

<p>I also can't read the bitmap with, for example, <code>BitmapFactory.decodeFile(file, options)</code>, providing a <code>BitmapFactory.Options.inSampleSize</code>, because I want to resize it to an exact width and height. Using <code>inSampleSize</code> would resize the bitmap to 972x648 (if I use <code>inSampleSize=4</code>) or to 778x518 (if I use <code>inSampleSize=5</code>, which isn't even a power of 2).</p>

<p>I would also like to avoid reading the image using inSampleSize with, for example, 972x648 in a first step and then resizing it to exactly 800x533 in a second step, because the quality would be poor compared to a direct resizing of the original image.</p>

Is there a way to read a large image file with 10MP or more and save it to a new image file, resized to a specific new width and height, without getting an OutOfMemory exception?</p>

<p>I also tried <code>BitmapFactory.decodeFile(file, options)</code> and setting the Options.outHeight and Options.outWidth values manually to 800 and 533, but it doesn't work that way.</p>

"3357477","<p>I have investigated this problem for months now, came up with different solutions to it, which I am not happy with since they are all massive hacks. I still cannot believe that a class that flawed in design made it into the framework and no-one is talking about it, so I guess I just must be missing something.</p>

<p>The problem is with <code>AsyncTask</code>. According to the documentation it </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""allows to perform background
  operations and publish results on the
  UI thread without having to manipulate
  threads and/or handlers.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The example then continues to show how some exemplary <code>showDialog()</code> method is called in <code>onPostExecute()</code>. This, however, seems <strong>entirely contrived</strong> to me, because showing a dialog always needs a reference to a valid <code>Context</code>, and an AsyncTask <em>must never hold a strong reference to a context object</em>.</p>

<p>The reason is obvious: what if the activity gets destroyed which triggered the task? This can happen all the time, e.g. because you flipped the screen. If the task would hold a reference to the context that created it, you're not only holding on to a useless context object (the window will have been destroyed and <em>any</em> UI interaction will fail with an exception!), you even risk creating a memory leak.</p>

<p>Unless my logic is flawed here, this translates to: <code>onPostExecute()</code> is entirely useless, because what good is it for this method to run on the UI thread if you don't have access to any context? You can't do anything meaningful here.</p>

<p>One workaround would be to not pass context instances to an AsyncTask, but a <code>Handler</code> instance. That works: since a Handler loosely binds the context and the task, you can exchange messages between them without risking a leak (right?). But that would mean that the premise of AsyncTask, namely that you don't need to bother with handlers, is wrong. It also seems like abusing Handler, since you are sending and receiving messages on the same thread (you create it on the UI thread and send through it in onPostExecute() which is also executed on the UI thread).</p>

<p>To top it all off, even with that workaround, you still have the problem that when the context gets destroyed, you have <em>no record</em> of the tasks it fired. That means that you have to re-start any tasks when re-creating the context, e.g. after a screen orientation change. This is slow and wasteful.</p>

<p>My solution to this (as <a href=""https://github.com/mttkay/droid-fu/"" rel=""noreferrer"">implemented in the Droid-Fu library</a>) is to maintain a mapping of <code>WeakReference</code>s from component names to their current instances on the unique application object. Whenever an AsyncTask is started, it records the calling context in that map, and on every callback, it will fetch the current context instance from that mapping. This ensures that you will never reference a stale context instance <em>and</em> you always have access to a valid context in the callbacks so you can do meaningful UI work there. It also doesn't leak, because the references are weak and are cleared when no instance of a given component exists anymore.</p>

<p>Still, it is a complex workaround and requires to sub-class some of the Droid-Fu library classes, making this a pretty intrusive approach.</p>

<p><strong>Now I simply want to know:</strong> Am I just massively missing something or is AsyncTask really entirely flawed? How are your experiences working with it? How did you solve these problem?</p>

  navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(foundLocation, noLocation);

<p>Basically what's happening here is we get the current position, if it's obtained, two ""watermarks"" are placed in two fields that say ""Current Position"" and two hidden fields are created with the lat-long data as their value (they're removed in the beginning so they don't get duplicated every time). There are also two buttons that have a click function tied to them that do the same thing.
Unfortunately, every third time or so, it works.

"3491811","<p>I've started tinkering with Node.js HTTP server and really like to write server side Javascript but something is keeping me from starting to use Node.js for my web application.</p>

<p>I understand the whole async I/O concept but I'm somewhat concerned about the edge cases where procedural code is very CPU intensive such as image manipulation or sorting large data sets.</p>

<p>As I understand it, the server will be very fast for simple web page requests such as viewing a listing of users or viewing a blog post. However, if I want to write very CPU intensive code (in the admin back end for example) that generates graphics or resizes thousands of images, the request will be very slow (a few seconds). Since this code is not async, every requests coming to the server during those few seconds will be blocked until my slow request is done. </p>

<p>One suggestion was to use Web Workers for CPU intensive tasks. However, I'm afraid web workers will make it hard to write clean code since it works by including a separate JS file. What if the CPU intensive code is located in an object's method? It kind of sucks to write a JS file for every method that is CPU intensive.</p>

<p>Another suggestion was to spawn a child process, but that makes the code even less maintainable.</p>

<p>Any suggestions to overcome this (perceived) obstacle? How do you write clean object oriented code with Node.js while making sure CPU heavy tasks are executed async? </p>

"3492302","<p>I had an interesting job interview experience a while back. The question started really easy:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q1</strong>: We have a bag containing numbers <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, <code>3</code>, …, <code>100</code>. Each number appears exactly once, so there are 100 numbers. Now one number is randomly picked out of the bag. Find the missing number.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've heard this interview question before, of course, so I very quickly answered along the lines of:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>A1</strong>: Well, the sum of the numbers <code>1 + 2 + 3 + … + N</code> is <code>(N+1)(N/2)</code> (see <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_sum#Sum"" rel=""noreferrer"">Wikipedia: sum of arithmetic series</a>). For <code>N = 100</code>, the sum is <code>5050</code>.</p>
<p>Thus, if all numbers are present in the bag, the sum will be exactly <code>5050</code>. Since one number is missing, the sum will be less than this, and the difference is that number. So we can find that missing number in <code>O(N)</code> time and <code>O(1)</code> space.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At this point I thought I had done well, but all of a sudden the question took an unexpected turn:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q2</strong>: That is correct, but now how would you do this if <em>TWO</em> numbers are missing?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I had never seen/heard/considered this variation before, so I panicked and couldn't answer the question. The interviewer insisted on knowing my thought process, so I mentioned that perhaps we can get more information by comparing against the expected product, or perhaps doing a second pass after having gathered some information from the first pass, etc, but I really was just shooting in the dark rather than actually having a clear path to the solution.</p>
<p>The interviewer did try to encourage me by saying that having a second equation is indeed one way to solve the problem. At this point I was kind of upset (for not knowing the answer before hand), and asked if this is a general (read: &quot;useful&quot;) programming technique, or if it's just a trick/gotcha answer.</p>
<p>The interviewer's answer surprised me: you can generalize the technique to find 3 missing numbers. In fact, you can generalize it to find <em>k</em> missing numbers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Qk</strong>: If exactly <em>k</em> numbers are missing from the bag, how would you find it efficiently?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was a few months ago, and I still couldn't figure out what this technique is.  Obviously there's a <code>Ω(N)</code> time lower bound since we must scan all the numbers at least once, but the interviewer insisted that the <em>TIME</em> and <em>SPACE</em> complexity of the solving technique (minus the <code>O(N)</code> time input scan) is defined in <em>k</em> not <em>N</em>.</p>
<p>So the question here is simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>How would you solve <strong>Q2</strong>?</li>
<li>How would you solve <strong>Q3</strong>?</li>
<li>How would you solve <strong>Qk</strong>?</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Clarifications</h3>
<ul>
<li>Generally there are <em>N</em> numbers from 1..<em>N</em>, not just 1..100.</li>
<li>I'm not looking for the obvious set-based solution, e.g. using a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_array"" rel=""noreferrer"">bit set</a>, encoding the presence/absence each number by the value of a designated bit, therefore using <code>O(N)</code> bits in additional space. We can't afford any additional space proportional to <em>N</em>.</li>
<li>I'm also not looking for the obvious sort-first approach. This and the set-based approach are worth mentioning in an interview (they are easy to implement, and depending on <em>N</em>, can be very practical). I'm looking for the Holy Grail solution (which may or may not be practical to implement, but has the desired asymptotic characteristics nevertheless).</li>
</ul>
<p>So again, of course you must scan the input in <code>O(N)</code>, but you can only capture small amount of information (defined in terms of <em>k</em> not <em>N</em>), and must then find the <em>k</em> missing numbers somehow.</p>

<p>According to this article <a href=""http://www.javamex.com/tutorials/synchronization_volatile.shtml"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://www.javamex.com/tutorials/synchronization_volatile.shtml</a> there is a lot to be said and there are many differences but also some similarities.</p>

<p>I am particularly interested in this piece of info:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>...</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>access to a volatile variable never has the potential to block: we're only ever doing a simple read or write, so unlike a synchronized block we will never hold on to any lock;</li>
  <li>because accessing a volatile variable never holds a lock, it is not suitable for cases where we want to <strong>read-update-write</strong> as an atomic operation (unless we're prepared to ""miss an update"");</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>What do they mean by <strong>read-update-write</strong>? Isn't a write also an update or do they simply mean that the <strong>update</strong> is a write that depends on the read?</p>

<p>Most of all, when is it more suitable to declare variables <code>volatile</code> rather than access them through a <code>synchronized</code> block? Is it a good idea to use <code>volatile</code> for variables that depend on input? For instance, there is a variable called <code>render</code> that is read through the rendering loop and set by a keypress event?</p>

"3521290","<p><strong>This question is not about when to use GET or POST in general;</strong> it is about which is the recommended one for handling logging out of a web application. I have found plenty of information on the differences between GET and POST in the general sense, but I did not find a definite answer for this particular scenario.</p>

<p>As a pragmatist, I'm inclined to use GET, because implementing it is way simpler than POST; just drop a simple link and you're done. This seems to be case with the vast majority of websites I can think of, at least from the top of my head. Even Stack Overflow handles logging out with GET.</p>

<p>The thing making me hesitate is the (albeit old) argument that some web accelerators/proxies pre-cache pages by going and retrieving every link they find in the page, so the user gets a faster response when she clicks on them. I'm not sure if this still applies, but if this was the case, then in theory a user with one of these accelerators would get kicked out of the application as soon as she logs in, because her accelerator would find and retrieve the logout link even if she never clicked on it.</p>

<p>Everything I have read so far suggest that <em>POST should be used for ""destructive actions"", whereas actions that do not alter the internal state of the application -like querying and such- should be handled with GET</em>. Based on this, the real question here is:</p>

"3538021","<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64"" rel=""noreferrer"">Wikipedia</a> says</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Base64 encoding schemes are commonly used when there is a need to encode binary data that needs be stored and transferred over media that are designed to deal with textual data. This is to ensure that the data remains intact without modification during transport.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But is it not that data is always stored/transmitted in binary because the memory that our machines have store binary and it just depends how you interpret it? So, whether you encode the bit pattern <code>010011010110000101101110</code> as <code>Man</code> in ASCII or as <code>TWFu</code> in Base64, you are eventually going to store the same bit pattern.</p>

<p><strong>If the ultimate encoding is in terms of zeros and ones and every machine and media can deal with them, how does it matter if the data is represented as ASCII or Base64?</strong></p>

<p>What does it mean ""media that are designed to deal with textual data""? They can deal with binary => they can deal with anything.</p>

<hr>

<p>Thanks everyone, I think I understand now.</p>

<p>When we send over data, we cannot be sure that the data would be interpreted in the same format as we intended it to be. So, we send over data coded in some format (like Base64) that both parties understand. That way even if sender and receiver interpret same things differently, but because they agree on the coded format, the data will not get interpreted wrongly.</p>

<p>From <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3538021/why-do-we-use-base64/3538079#3538079"">Mark Byers example</a></p>

<p>If I want to send </p>

<pre><code>Hello
world!
</code></pre>

<p>One way is to send it in ASCII like </p>

<pre><code>72 101 108 108 111 10 119 111 114 108 100 33
</code></pre>

<p>But byte 10 might not be interpreted correctly as a newline at the other end. So, we use a subset of ASCII to encode it like this</p>

<pre><code>83 71 86 115 98 71 56 115 67 110 100 118 99 109 120 107 73 61 61
</code></pre>

<p>which at the cost of more data transferred for the same amount of information ensures that the receiver can decode the data in the intended way, even if the receiver happens to have different interpretations for the rest of the character set.</p>

"3538156","<p>This has to be a common question that all programmers have from time to time.
How do I read a line from a text file? Then the next question is always how do i write it back. </p>

<p>Of course most of you use a high level framework in day to day programming (which are fine to use in answers) but sometimes it's nice to know how to do it at a low level too.</p>

<p>I myself know how to do it in <code>C</code>, <code>C++</code> and <code>Objective-C</code>, but it sure would be handy to see how it's done in all of the popular languages, if only to help us make a better decision about what language to do our file io in. In particular I think it would be interesting to see how its done in the string manipulation languages, like: <code>python</code>, <code>ruby</code> and of course <code>perl</code>. </p>

<p>So I figure here we can create a <strong><em>community resource</em></strong> that we can all <strong><em>star</em></strong> to our profiles and refer to when we need to do <strong>file I/O</strong> in some new language. Not to mention the exposure we will all get to languages that we don't deal with on a day to day basis.</p>

<p><strong>This is how you need to answer:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Create a new text file called ""<strong>fileio.txt</strong>""</li>
<li>Write the first line ""hello"" to the text file.</li>
<li>Append the second line ""world"" to the text file.</li>
<li>Read the second line ""world"" into an input string.</li>
<li>Print the input string to the console.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Clarification:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>You should show how to do this in one programming language per answer only.</li>
<li>Assume that the text file doesn't exist beforehand</li>
<li>You don't need to reopen the text file after writing the first line</li>
</ul>

<p>No particular limit on the language.
<code>C</code>, <code>C++</code>, <code>C#</code>, <code>Java</code>, <code>Objective-C</code> are all great. </p>

<p>Now I can display a list of albums and tracks associated to them:</p>

<pre><code>$dql = '
    SELECT   a, tl, t
    FROM     Entity\Album a
    JOIN     a.tracklist tl
    JOIN     tl.track t
    ORDER BY tl.position ASC
';

$albums = $em-&gt;createQuery($dql)-&gt;getResult();

foreach ($albums as $album) {
    echo $album-&gt;getTitle() . PHP_EOL;

    foreach ($album-&gt;getTracklist() as $track) {
        echo sprintf(""\t#%d - %-20s (%s) %s\n"", 
            $track-&gt;getPosition(),

    }

<p>The results are what I'm expecting, ie: a list of albums with their tracks in appropriate order and promoted ones being marked as promoted.</p>

<pre><code>The Metallica Collection

    #3 - Battery              (00:05:13) 
</code></pre>

<h2>So what's wrong?</h2>

<p>This code demonstrates what's wrong:</p>

<pre><code>foreach ($album-&gt;getTracklist() as $track) {
    echo $track-&gt;getTrack()-&gt;getTitle();
}
</code></pre>

<p><code>Album::getTracklist()</code> returns an array of <code>AlbumTrackReference</code> objects instead of <code>Track</code> objects. I can't create proxy methods cause what if both, <code>Album</code> and <code>Track</code> would have <code>getTitle()</code> method? I could do some extra processing within <code>Album::getTracklist()</code> method but what's the most simply way to do that? Am I forced do write something like that?</p>

<pre><code>public function getTracklist() {
    $tracklist = array();

    foreach ($this-&gt;tracklist as $key =&gt; $trackReference) {
        $tracklist[$key] = $trackReference-&gt;getTrack();

        $tracklist[$key]-&gt;setPosition($trackReference-&gt;getPosition());
        $tracklist[$key]-&gt;setPromoted($trackReference-&gt;isPromoted());
    }

    return $tracklist;
}

// And some extra getters/setters in Track class
</code></pre>

<h1>EDIT</h1>

<p>@beberlei suggested to use proxy methods:</p>

<pre><code>class AlbumTrackReference {
    public function getTitle() {
        return $this-&gt;getTrack()-&gt;getTitle()
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>That would be a good idea but I'm using that ""reference object"" from both sides: <code>$album-&gt;getTracklist()[12]-&gt;getTitle()</code> and <code>$track-&gt;getAlbums()[1]-&gt;getTitle()</code>, so <code>getTitle()</code> method should return different data based on the context of invocation.</p>

<p>I would have to do something like:</p>

<pre><code> getTracklist() {
     foreach ($this-&gt;tracklist as $trackRef) { $trackRef-&gt;setContext($this); }
 }

 // ....

 getAlbums() {
     foreach ($this-&gt;tracklist as $trackRef) { $trackRef-&gt;setContext($this); }
 }

 // ...

 AlbumTrackRef::getTitle() {
      return $this-&gt;{$this-&gt;context}-&gt;getTitle();
 }
</code></pre>

<li><p>Create a Policy table and numerous Section tables, one for each kind of cover.</p></li>

<p>If I query that URL from a browser directly it works fine.  What is going on, and can I get around this?  Am I composing my query incorrectly, or is this something that Panoramio does to hinder what I'm trying to do?</p>

<p>Forking makes my version of the project more isolated from the original one because I don't have to be on the collaborators list of the original project. Since we're developing a project in house, there is no problem in adding people as collaborators. But, we'd like to understand if forking a project would make merge changes back to the main project harder. That is, I wonder if branching makes keeping the two projects in sync easier. In other words, is it easier to merge and push changes between my version of the main project and the main project when I branch? </p>

                    on animal.SpeciesKey equals race.SpeciesKey

                           select animal).Distinct();
</code></pre>

<p>I changed the names of my original objects so that this looks like a more generic example. The query itself is not that important. What I want to ask is this:</p>

<pre><code>foreach (Animal animal in sel) { /*do stuff*/ }
</code></pre>

<ol>
<li><p>I noticed that if I use <code>IEnumerable</code>, when I debug and inspect ""sel"", which in that case is the IEnumerable, it has some interesting members: ""inner"", ""outer"", ""innerKeySelector"" and ""outerKeySelector"", these last 2 appear to be delegates. The ""inner"" member does not have ""Animal"" instances in it, but rather ""Species"" instances, which was very strange for me. The ""outer"" member does contain ""Animal"" instances. I presume that the two delegates determine which goes in and what goes out of it?</p></li>
<li><p>I noticed that if I use ""Distinct"", the ""inner"" contains 6 items (this is incorrect as only 2 are Distinct), but the ""outer"" does contain the correct values. Again, probably the delegated methods determine this but this is a bit more than I know about IEnumerable.</p></li>

"3629709","<p>I just discovered that every request in an ASP.Net web application gets a Session lock at the beginning of a request, and then releases it at the end of the request!</p>

<p>In case the implications of this are lost on you, as it was for me at first, this basically means the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Anytime an ASP.Net webpage is taking a long time to load (maybe due to a slow database call or whatever), and the user decides they want to navigate to a different page because they are tired of waiting, THEY CAN'T! The ASP.Net session lock forces the new page request to wait until the original request has finished its painfully slow load. Arrrgh.</p></li>
<li><p>Anytime an UpdatePanel is loading slowly, and the user decides to navigate to a different page before the UpdatePanel has finished updating... THEY CAN'T! The ASP.net session lock forces the new page request to wait until the original request has finished its painfully slow load. Double Arrrgh!</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So what are the options?  So far I have come up with:</p>

<ul>
<li>Implement a Custom SessionStateDataStore, which ASP.Net supports.  I haven't found too many out there to copy, and it seems kind of high risk and easy to mess up.</li>
<li>Keep track of all requests in progress, and if a request comes in from the same user, cancel the original request.  Seems kind of extreme, but it would work (I think).</li>
<li>Don't use Session!  When I need some kind of state for the user, I could just use Cache instead, and key items on the authenticated username, or some such thing. Again seems kind of extreme.</li>
</ul>

<p>I really can't believe that the ASP.Net Microsoft team would have left such a huge performance bottleneck in the framework at version 4.0! Am I missing something obvious? How hard would it be to use a ThreadSafe collection for the Session?</p>

<p>Mainly, at one point Ryan Dahl (Node.js' creator) says that Node.js is event-loop based instead of thread-based.  Threads are expensive and should only be left to the experts of concurrent programming to be utilized.  </p>

<p>Later, he then shows the architecture stack of Node.js which has an underlying C implementation which has its own Thread pool internally.  So obviously Node.js developers would never kick off their own threads or use the thread pool directly...they use async call-backs.  That much I understand.</p>

<p>What I don't understand is the point that Node.js still is using threads...it's just hiding the implementation so how is this faster if 50 people request 50 files (not currently in memory) well then aren't 50 threads required?</p>

<p>The only difference being that since it's managed internally the Node.js developer doesn't have to code the threaded details but underneath it's still using the threads to process the IO (blocking) file requests.</p>

<p>So aren't you really just taking one problem (threading) and hiding it while that problem still exists: mainly multiple threads, context switching, dead-locks...etc?  </p>

<p>There must be some detail I still do not understand here.</p>

"3635166","<p>I have an unnormalized events-diary CSV from a client that I'm trying to load into a MySQL table so that I can refactor into a sane format. I created a table called 'CSVImport' that has one field for every column of the CSV file. The CSV contains 99 columns , so this was a hard enough task in itself:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE 'CSVImport' (id INT);
ALTER TABLE CSVImport ADD COLUMN Title VARCHAR(256);
ALTER TABLE CSVImport ADD COLUMN Company VARCHAR(256);
ALTER TABLE CSVImport ADD COLUMN NumTickets VARCHAR(256);
...
ALTER TABLE CSVImport Date49 ADD COLUMN Date49 VARCHAR(256);
ALTER TABLE CSVImport Date50 ADD COLUMN Date50 VARCHAR(256);
</code></pre>

<p>No constraints are on the table, and all the fields hold VARCHAR(256) values, except the columns which contain counts (represented by INT), yes/no (represented by BIT), prices (represented by DECIMAL), and text blurbs (represented by TEXT).</p>

<p>I tried to load data into the file:</p>

<pre><code>LOAD DATA INFILE '/home/paul/clientdata.csv' INTO TABLE CSVImport;
Query OK, 2023 rows affected, 65535 warnings (0.08 sec)
Records: 2023  Deleted: 0  Skipped: 0  Warnings: 198256
SELECT * FROM CSVImport;
| NULL             | NULL        | NULL           | NULL | NULL               | 
...
</code></pre>

<p>The whole table is filled with <code>NULL</code>.</p>

<p>I think the problem is that the text blurbs contain more than one line, and MySQL is parsing the file as if each new line would correspond to one databazse row. I can load the file into OpenOffice without a problem.</p>

<p>The clientdata.csv file contains 2593 lines, and 570 records. The first line contains column names. I think it is comma delimited, and text is apparently delimited with doublequote.</p>

<p>UPDATE:</p>

<p>When in doubt, read the manual: <a href=""http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/load-data.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/load-data.html</a></p>

<p>I added some information to the <code>LOAD DATA</code> statement that OpenOffice was smart enough to infer, and now it loads the correct number of records:</p>

<pre><code>LOAD DATA INFILE ""/home/paul/clientdata.csv""
INTO TABLE CSVImport
COLUMNS TERMINATED BY ','
OPTIONALLY ENCLOSED BY '""'
ESCAPED BY '""'
LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
IGNORE 1 LINES;
</code></pre>

<p>But still there are lots of completely <code>NULL</code> records, and none of the data that got loaded seems to be in the right place.</p>

"3684484","<p>I'm helping a veterinary clinic measuring pressure under a dogs paw. I use Python for my data analysis and now I'm stuck trying to divide the paws into (anatomical) subregions.</p>

<p>I made a 2D array of each paw, that consists of the maximal values for each sensor that has been loaded by the paw over time. Here's an example of one paw, where I used Excel to draw the areas I want to 'detect'. These are 2 by 2 boxes around the sensor with local maxima's, that together have the largest sum.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/BuUbq.png"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>So I tried some experimenting and decide to simply look for the maximums of each column and row (can't look in one direction due to the shape of the paw). This seems to 'detect' the location of the separate toes fairly well, but it also marks neighboring sensors. </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/UyNRU.png"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>So what would be the best way to tell Python which of these maximums are the ones I want? </p>

<p><strong>Note: The 2x2 squares can't overlap, since they have to be separate toes!</strong></p>

<p>Also I took 2x2 as a convenience, any more advanced solution is welcome, but I'm simply a human movement scientist, so I'm neither a real programmer or a mathematician, so please keep it 'simple'. </p>

<h2>Results</h2>

<p>So I tried @jextee's solution (see the results below). As you can see, it works very on the front paws, but it works less well for the hind legs. </p>

<p>More specifically, it can't recognize the small peak that's the fourth toe. This is obviously inherent to the fact that the loop looks top down towards the lowest value, without taking into account where this is. </p>

<p>Would anyone know how to tweak @jextee's algorithm, so that it might be able to find the 4th toe too?</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/FFX0x.png"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>Since I haven't processed any other trials yet, I can't supply any other samples. But the data I gave before were the averages of each paw. This file is an array with the maximal data of 9 paws in the order they made contact with the plate.</p>

<p>This image shows how they were spatially spread out over the plate.</p>

<hr>

<h2>New update:</h2>

<p>So after the help I got with my questions regarding <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/q/4087919/77595"">paw detection</a> and <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/q/4502656/77595"">paw sorting</a>, I was finally able to check the toe detection for every paw! Turns out, it doesn't work so well in anything but paws sized like the one in my own example. Off course in hindsight, it's my own fault for choosing the 2x2 so arbitrarily.</p>

<p>Here's a nice example of where it goes wrong: a nail is being recognized as a toe and the 'heel' is so wide, it gets recognized twice!</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/JEpIa.png"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>The paw is too large, so taking a 2x2 size with no overlap, causes some toes to be detected twice. The other way around, in small dogs it often fails to find a 5th toe, which I suspect is being caused by the 2x2 area being too large.</p>

<p>After <a href=""http://www.flipserd.com/blog/ivoflipse/post/toe-detection-revisited"" rel=""noreferrer"">trying the current solution on all my measurements</a> I came to the staggering conclusion that for nearly all my small dogs it didn't find a 5th toe and that in over 50% of the impacts for the large dogs it would find more!</p>

<p>So clearly I need to change it. My own guess was changing the size of the <code>neighborhood</code> to something smaller for small dogs and larger for large dogs. But <code>generate_binary_structure</code> wouldn't let me change the size of the array. </p>

<p>Therefore, I'm hoping that anyone else has a better suggestion for locating the toes, perhaps having the toe area scale with the paw size?</p>

<p>Also, I've noticed that applicationWillResignActive gets called when an incoming SMS or call comes in but the user chooses to click Ok and continue.  I don't want my app to take any action in these cases.  I just want it to keep running without any intermediate cleanup since the user didn't exit the app.  So, I would think it makes more sense to do cleanup work just in applicationDidEnterBackground.</p>

<p>I would appreciate your input on best practices to follow on choosing which delegates to implement for waking up and going to sleep as well as considering events like being interrupted by SMS/calls.</p>

"3724415","<p>I'm currently in the process of moving some project from Ant to Maven. Conformist as I am, I want to use well-established conventions for finding <code>groupId</code> and <code>artifactId</code>, but I can't find any detailed conventions (there are some, but they don't cover the points I'm wondering about).</p>

<p>Take this project for instance, first the Java package: <code>com.mycompany.teatimer</code></p>

<p><em>Tea timer</em> is actually two words, but the Java package naming conventions forbid the insertion of underscores or hyphens, so I'm writing it all together.</p>

<p>I chose the <code>groupId</code> identical to the package ID because I think that's a good idea. Is it?</p>

<p>Finally, I have to pick an <code>artifactId</code>, I currently went for <code>teatimer</code>. But when I look at other Maven projects, they use hyphens to split words in <code>artifactId</code>s, like this: <code>tea-timer</code>. But it does look weird when concatenated to the <code>groupId</code>: <code>com.mycompany.teatimer.tea-timer</code>.</p>

<p>How would you do this?</p>

<p>Another example:</p>

<p>Package name: <code>com.mycompany.awesomeinhouseframework</code></p>

<p><code>groupId</code>: <code>com.mycompany.awesomeinhouseframework</code> (?)</p>

<p>This is a collection of questions that come up every now and then about syntax in PHP. This is also a Community Wiki, so everyone is invited to participate in maintaining this list.</p>
<h3>Why is this?</h3>
<p>It used to be hard to find questions about operators and other syntax tokens.¹<br />
The main idea is to have links to existing questions on Stack Overflow, so it's easier for us to reference them, not to copy over content from the PHP Manual.</p>
<p>Note: Since January 2013, Stack Overflow <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/160100/a-new-search-engine-for-stack-exchange"">does support special characters</a>. Just surround the search terms by quotes, e.g. <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=%5Bphp%5D%20%22===%22%20vs%20%22==%22""><code>[php] &quot;==&quot; vs &quot;===&quot;</code></a></p>
<h3><strong>What should I do here?</strong></h3>

"3789340","<p>I'm working on a project that has a lot of legacy <strong>C</strong> code.  We've started writing in C++, with the intent to eventually convert the legacy code, as well.  I'm a little confused about how the <strong>C</strong> and C++ interact.  I understand that by wrapping the <strong>C</strong> code with <code>extern ""C""</code> the C++ compiler will not mangle the <strong>C</strong> code's names, but I'm not entirely sure how to implement this.</p>

<p>So, at the top of each <strong>C</strong> header file (after the include guards), we have</p>

<pre><code>#ifdef __cplusplus
extern ""C"" {
#endif
</code></pre>

<p>and at the bottom, we write</p>

<pre><code>#ifdef __cplusplus
}
#endif
</code></pre>

<p>In between the two, we have all of our includes, typedefs, and function prototypes.  I have a few questions, to see if I'm understanding this correctly:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>If I have a C++ file A.hh which
includes a <strong>C</strong> header file B.h,
includes another <strong>C</strong> header file C.h,
how does this work?  I think that
when the compiler steps into B.h,
<code>__cplusplus</code> will be defined, so it
will wrap the code with <code>extern ""C""</code>
(and <code>__cplusplus</code> will not be
defined inside this block).  So,
when it steps into C.h,
<code>__cplusplus</code> will not be defined
and the code will not be wrapped in
<code>extern ""C""</code>.  Is this correct?</p></li>
<li><p>Is there anything wrong with
wrapping a piece of code with
<code>extern ""C"" { extern ""C"" { .. } }</code>? 
What will the second <code>extern ""C""</code>
do?</p></li>
<li><p>We don't put this wrapper around the .c files, just the .h files.  So, what happens if a function doesn't have a prototype? Does the compiler think that it's a C++ function?</p></li>
<li><p>We are also using some third-party
code which is written in <strong>C</strong>, and does
not have this sort of wrapper around
it.  Any time I include a header
from that library, I've been putting
an <code>extern ""C""</code> around the #include.
Is this the right way to deal with
that?</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, is this set up a good idea?
Is there anything else we should do?
We're going to be mixing <strong>C</strong> and C++
for the foreseeable future, and I
want to make sure we're covering all
our bases.</p></li>

"3801681","<p>I lately had the problem of creating add and edit dialogs for my wpf app.</p>

<p>All I want to do in my code was something like this. (I mostly use viewmodel first approach with mvvm)</p>

<p>ViewModel which calls a dialog window:</p>

<pre><code>var result = this.uiDialogService.ShowDialog(""Dialogwindow Title"", dialogwindowVM);
// Do anything with the dialog result
</code></pre>

<p>How does it work?</p>

<p>First, I created a dialog service:</p>

<pre><code>public interface IUIWindowDialogService
{
    bool? ShowDialog(string title, object datacontext);
}

public class WpfUIWindowDialogService : IUIWindowDialogService
{
    public bool? ShowDialog(string title, object datacontext)
    {
        var win = new WindowDialog();
        win.Title = title;
        win.DataContext = datacontext;

        return win.ShowDialog();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p><code>WindowDialog</code> is a special but simple window.  I need it to hold my content:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Window x:Class=""WindowDialog""
    xmlns=""http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation"" 
    Title=""WindowDialog"" 
    WindowStyle=""SingleBorderWindow"" 
    WindowStartupLocation=""CenterOwner"" SizeToContent=""WidthAndHeight""&gt;
    &lt;ContentPresenter x:Name=""DialogPresenter"" Content=""{Binding .}""&gt;

    &lt;/ContentPresenter&gt;
&lt;/Window&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>A problem with dialogs in wpf is the <code>dialogresult = true</code> can only be achieved in code.  That's why I created an interface for my <code>dialogviewmodel</code> to implement it. </p>

<pre><code>public class RequestCloseDialogEventArgs : EventArgs
{
    public bool DialogResult { get; set; }
    public RequestCloseDialogEventArgs(bool dialogresult)
    {
        this.DialogResult = dialogresult;
    }
}

public interface IDialogResultVMHelper
{
    event EventHandler&lt;RequestCloseDialogEventArgs&gt; RequestCloseDialog;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Whenever my ViewModel thinks it's time for <code>dialogresult = true</code>, then raise this event.</p>

<pre><code>public partial class DialogWindow : Window
{
    // Note: If the window is closed, it has no DialogResult
    private bool _isClosed = false;

    public DialogWindow()
    {
        InitializeComponent();
        this.DialogPresenter.DataContextChanged += DialogPresenterDataContextChanged;
        this.Closed += DialogWindowClosed;
    }

    void DialogWindowClosed(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        this._isClosed = true;
    }

    private void DialogPresenterDataContextChanged(object sender,
                              DependencyPropertyChangedEventArgs e)
    {
        var d = e.NewValue as IDialogResultVMHelper;

        if (d == null)
            return;

        d.RequestCloseDialog += new EventHandler&lt;RequestCloseDialogEventArgs&gt;
                                    (DialogResultTrueEvent).MakeWeak(
                                        eh =&gt; d.RequestCloseDialog -= eh;);
    }

    private void DialogResultTrueEvent(object sender, 
                              RequestCloseDialogEventArgs eventargs)
    {
        // Important: Do not set DialogResult for a closed window
        // GC clears windows anyways and with MakeWeak it
        // closes out with IDialogResultVMHelper
        if(_isClosed) return;

        this.DialogResult = eventargs.DialogResult;
    }
 }
</code></pre>

<p>Now at least I have to create a <code>DataTemplate</code> in my resource file(<code>app.xaml</code> or something):</p>

<pre><code>&lt;DataTemplate DataType=""{x:Type DialogViewModel:EditOrNewAuswahlItemVM}"" &gt;
        &lt;DialogView:EditOrNewAuswahlItem/&gt;
&lt;/DataTemplate&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Well thats all, I can now call dialogs from my viewmodels:</p>

<pre><code> var result = this.uiDialogService.ShowDialog(""Dialogwindow Title"", dialogwindowVM);
</code></pre>

<p>Now my question, do you see any problems with this solution?</p>

<p>Edit: for completeness. The ViewModel should implement <code>IDialogResultVMHelper</code> and then it can raise it within a <code>OkCommand</code> or something like this:</p>

<pre><code>public class MyViewmodel : IDialogResultVMHelper
{
    private readonly Lazy&lt;DelegateCommand&gt; _okCommand;

    public MyViewmodel()
    {
         this._okCommand = new Lazy&lt;DelegateCommand&gt;(() =&gt; 
             new DelegateCommand(() =&gt; 
                 InvokeRequestCloseDialog(
                     new RequestCloseDialogEventArgs(true)), () =&gt; 
                         YourConditionsGoesHere = true));
    }

    public ICommand OkCommand
    { 
        get { return this._okCommand.Value; } 
    }

    public event EventHandler&lt;RequestCloseDialogEventArgs&gt; RequestCloseDialog;
    private void InvokeRequestCloseDialog(RequestCloseDialogEventArgs e)
    {
        var handler = RequestCloseDialog;
        if (handler != null) 
            handler(this, e);
    }
 }
</code></pre>

<p>For example - I login using <code>username='rasmus'</code> and <code>password='default'</code>. In such a case the data will be posted to the server which is supposed to check and log me in if authenticated.

Now the server also stores this session ID in its file system or datastore. </p>

<p>What about Haskell?  Can Haskell provide some of the benefits of Node.js, namely a clean solution to avoid blocking I/O without having recourse to multi-thread programming?</p>

<hr>

<p>There are many things that are attractive with Node.js</p>

<ol>
<li>Events: No thread manipulation, the programmer only provides callbacks (as in Snap framework)</li>
<li>Callbacks are guaranteed to be run in a single thread: no race condition possible.</li>
<li>Nice and simple UNIX-friendly API.  Bonus: Excellent HTTP support. DNS also available.</li>
<li>Every I/O is by default asynchronous. This makes it easier to avoid locks.  However, too much CPU processing in a callback will impact other connections (in this case, the task should split into smaller sub-tasks and re-scheduled).</li>
<li>Same language for client-side and server-side. (I don't see too much value in this one, however.  jQuery and Node.js share the event programming model but the rest is very different.  I just can't see how sharing code between server-side and client-side could be useful in practice.)</li>

"3849634","<p>I have been lately reading a lot on memory allocation schemes in java, and there have been many doubts as I have been reading from various sources. I have collected my concepts, and I would request to go through all of the points and comment on them. I came to know that memory allocation is JVM specific, so I must say beforehand, that my question is Sun specific.</p>

<ol>
<li>Classes (loaded by the classloaders) go in a special area on heap : Permanent Generation</li>
<li>All the information related to a class like name of the class, Object arrays associated with the class, internal objects used by JVM (like java/lang/Object) and optimization information goes into the Permanent Generation area.</li>
<li>All the static member variables are kept on the Permanent Generation area again.</li>
<li>Objects go on a different heap : Young generation</li>
<li>There is only one copy of each method per class, be the method static or non-static. That copy is put in the Permanent Generation area.
For non-static methods, all the parameters and local variables go onto the stack - and whenever there is a concrete invocation of that method, we get a new stack-frame associated with it.
I am not sure where are the local variables of a static method are stored. Are they on the heap of Permanent Generation ? Or just their reference is stored in the Permanent Generation area, and the actual copy is somewhere else (Where ?)</li>
<li>I am also unsure where does the return type of a method get stored.</li>
<li>If the objects (in the young generation) needs to use a static member (in the permanent generation), they are given a reference to the static member &amp;&amp; they are given enough memory space to store the return type of the method,etc.</li>

"3889634","<p>There has been many Questions recently about drawing PDF's. </p>

<p>Yes, you can render PDF's very easily with a <code>UIWebView</code> but this cant give the performance and functionality that you would expect from a good PDF viewer.</p>

<p>You can draw a PDF page <a href=""http://www.cocoabuilder.com/archive/cocoa/196313-display-pdf-in-calayer.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">to a CALayer</a> or <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3831304/calayer-and-off-screen-rendering/3853778#3853778""> to a UIImage</a>. Apple even have sample code to show how draw a large PDF <a href=""http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#samplecode/ZoomingPDFViewer/Introduction/Intro.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/DTS40010281"" rel=""noreferrer"">in a Zoomable UIScrollview</a></p>

<p>But the same issues keep cropping up.</p>

<p><strong>UIImage Method:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>PDF's in a <code>UIImage</code> don't optically
scale as well as a Layer approach.</li>
<li>The CPU and memory hit on generating
the <code>UIImages</code> from a <code>PDFcontext</code>
limits/prevents using it to create a
real-time render of new zoom-levels.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>CATiledLayer Method:</strong></p>

<ol start=""3"">
<li>Theres a significant Overhead (time)
drawing a full PDF page to a <code>CALayer</code>: individual tiles can be seen rendering (even with a tileSize tweak)</li>
<li><code>CALayers</code> cant be prepared ahead  of
    time (rendered off-screen).</li>
</ol>

<p>Generally PDF viewers are pretty heavy on memory too. Even monitor the memory usage of apple's zoomable PDF example.</p>

<p>In my current project, I'm developing a PDF viewer and am rendering a <code>UIImage</code> of a page in a separate thread (issues here too!) and presenting it while the scale is x1. <code>CATiledLayer</code> rendering kicks in once the scale is >1.  iBooks takes a similar double take approach as if you scroll the pages you can see a lower res version of the page for just less than a second before a crisp version appears.</p>

<p>Im rendering 2 pages each side of the page in focus so that the PDF image is ready to mask the layer before it starts drawing.Pages are destroyed again when they are +2 pages away from the focused page.</p>

<p><strong>Does anyone have any insights, no matter how small or obvious to improve the performance/ memory handling of Drawing PDF's? or any other issues discussed here?</strong></p>

<p><strong><em>EDIT:</em></strong> Some Tips (Credit- Luke Mcneice,VdesmedT,Matt Gallagher,Johann):</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Save any media to disk when you can.</p></li>
<li><p>Use larger tileSizes if rendering on TiledLayers</p></li>
<li><p>init frequently used arrays with placeholder objects, alternitively another design approach is <a href=""http://cocoawithlove.com/2009/01/multiple-virtual-pages-in-uiscrollview.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">this one</a></p></li>
<li><p>Note that images will render faster than a <code>CGPDFPageRef</code></p></li>
<li><p>Use <code>NSOperations</code> or GCD &amp; <a href=""http://thirdcog.eu/pwcblocks/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Blocks</a> to prepare pages ahead
of time.</p></li>
<li><p>call <code>CGContextSetInterpolationQuality(ctx, kCGInterpolationHigh); CGContextSetRenderingIntent(ctx, kCGRenderingIntentDefault);</code> before <code>CGContextDrawPDFPage</code> to reduce memory usage while drawing </p></li>
<li><p>init'ing your <code>NSOperations</code> with a docRef is a bad idea (memory), wrap the docRef into a singleton.</p></li>
<li><p>Cancel needless <code>NSOperations</code> When you can, especially if they will be using memory, beware of leaving contexts open though!</p></li>
<li><p>Recycle page objects and destroy unused views</p></li>
<li><p>Close any open Contexts as soon as you don't need them</p></li>
<li><p>on receiving memory warnings release and reload the DocRef and any page Caches</p></li>

"3900549","<p>I have heard about things like ""C Runtime"", ""Visual C++ 2008 Runtime"", "".NET Common Language Runtime"", etc.</p>

<ul>
<li>What is ""<strong>runtime</strong>"" exactly?</li>
<li>What is it made of?</li>
<li>How does it interact with my code? Or maybe more precisely, how is my code controlled by it?</li>
</ul>

<p>When coding assembly language on Linux, I could use the INT instruction to make the system call. So, is the runtime nothing but a bunch of pre-fabricated functions that wrap the low level function into more abstract and high level functions? But doesn't this seem more like the definition for the library, not for the runtime?</p>

<p>Are ""runtime"" and ""<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runtime_library"" rel=""noreferrer"">runtime library</a>"" two different things?</p>

<h2>ADD 1</h2>

<p>These days, I am thinking maybe <em>Runtime</em> has something in common with the so called <em>Virtual Machine</em>, such as JVM. Here's the quotation that leads to such thought:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This compilation process is sufficiently complex to be broken into
  several layers of abstraction, and these usually involve three

  assembler.  --- <a href=""https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/0262640686"" rel=""noreferrer"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The Elements of Computing Systems</a> (Introduction,

"3915961","<p>OK here's what I would like: in the Eclipse package explorer, I see the following: (dot represents a clickable arrow that I can use to expand the folder)</p>

<p><ul>
<li>PROJECT
<ul><li> Source Folder 
         <ul><li>Package
<ul> Class </ul><li>Package.SubPackage<ul>Foo</ul><ul>Bar</ul><li>Package.OtherSubPackage<li>Package.OtherSubPackage.VerySubPackage
<li>OtherPackage <ul> Foobar </ul><li> OtherPackage.SubPackage
<ul> Baz</ul></ul></ul></ul></p>

<p>Long story short, I want to have many packages, each with many subpackages, in a source folder (and several source folders, so making more won't solve the problem)--so on the order of a couple hundred packages per source folder--ten to twenty packages each with fifteen subpackages. Therefore, I want the hierarchy to look like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>PROJECT
<ul><li> Source Folder 
         <ul><li>Package
<ul> Class
<li>Package.SubPackage
<ul> Foo</ul>
<ul>Bar</ul><li>Package.OtherSubPackage<ul><li>Package.OtherSubPackage.VerySubPackage</ul></ul></ul>
<ul><li>OtherPackage <ul> Foobar
<li> OtherPackage.SubPackage
<ul> Baz</ul></ul></ul></ul></ul>

<p>so I can open or close a package and see a list of subpackages instead of having package and subpackage all at the same level in the hierarchy--which again makes far too many packages simultaneously displayed. Note this is <em>not</em> a question about filesystem; the file system works fine as far as I can tell--it is only a question about the <em>visual display</em> in the Eclipse package explorer.</p>

<p>So: is there a way to add levels to the hierarchy? Thanks!! (Eclipse Helios on OS X 10.6)</p>

"3928193","<p>In iOS, there is a very easy and powerful facility to animate the addition and removal of UITableView rows, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhSWE6_ieyA#t=1m10s"" rel=""noreferrer"">here's a clip from a youtube video</a> showing the default animation.  Note how the surrounding rows collapse onto the deleted row.  This animation helps users keep track of what changed in a list and where in the list they were looking at when the data changed.</p>

<p>Since I've been developing on Android I've found no equivalent facility to animate individual rows in a <a href=""http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/ListView.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">TableView</a>.  Calling <a href=""http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/BaseAdapter.html#notifyDataSetChanged()"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>notifyDataSetChanged()</code></a> on my Adapter causes the ListView to immediately update its content with new information.  I'd like to show a simple animation of a new row pushing in or sliding out when the data changes, but I can't find any documented way to do this.  It looks like <a href=""http://LayoutAnimationController"" rel=""noreferrer"">LayoutAnimationController</a> might hold a key to getting this to work, but when I set a LayoutAnimationController on my ListView (similar to <a href=""http://developer.android.com/resources/samples/ApiDemos/src/com/example/android/apis/view/LayoutAnimation2.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">ApiDemo's LayoutAnimation2</a>) and remove elements from my adapter after the list has displayed, the elements disappear immediately instead of getting animated out.</p>

<p>I've also tried things like the following to animate an individual item when it is removed:</p>

<pre><code>@Override
protected void onListItemClick(ListView l, View v, final int position, long id) {
    Animation animation = new ScaleAnimation(1, 1, 1, 0);
    animation.setDuration(100);
    getListView().getChildAt(position).startAnimation(animation);
    l.postDelayed(new Runnable() {
        public void run() {
            mStringList.remove(position);
            mAdapter.notifyDataSetChanged();
        }
    }, 100);
}
</code></pre>

<p>However, the rows surrounding the animated row don't move position until they jump to their new positions when <code>notifyDataSetChanged()</code> is called.  It appears ListView doesn't update its layout once its elements have been placed.</p>

<p>While writing my own implementation/fork of ListView has crossed my mind, this seems like something that shouldn't be so difficult.</p>

"3937387","<p>I have been trying to figure out how to rotate videos with FFmpeg. I am working with iPhone videos taken in portrait mode. I know how to determine the current degrees of rotation using <a href=""http://mediainfo.sourceforge.net/en"">MediaInfo</a> (excellent library, btw) but I'm stuck on FFmpeg now.</p>

<p>From what I've read, what you need to use is a <strong>vfilter</strong> option. According to what I see, it should look like this:</p>

<pre><code>ffmpeg -vfilters ""rotate=90"" -i input.mp4 output.mp4
</code></pre>

<p>However, I can't get this to work. First, <strong>-vfilters</strong> doesn't exist anymore, it's now just <strong>-vf</strong>. Second, I get this error:</p>

<pre><code>No such filter: 'rotate'
Error opening filters!
</code></pre>

<p>As far as I know, I have an all-options-on build of FFmpeg. Running <strong><em>ffmpeg -filters</em></strong> shows this:</p>

<pre><code>Filters:
anull            Pass the source unchanged to the output.
aspect           Set the frame aspect ratio.
crop             Crop the input video to x:y:width:height.
fifo             Buffer input images and send them when they are requested.
format           Convert the input video to one of the specified pixel formats.
hflip            Horizontally flip the input video.
noformat         Force libavfilter not to use any of the specified pixel formats
 for the input to the next filter.
null             Pass the source unchanged to the output.
pad              Pad input image to width:height[:x:y[:color]] (default x and y:
 0, default color: black).
pixdesctest      Test pixel format definitions.
pixelaspect      Set the pixel aspect ratio.
scale            Scale the input video to width:height size and/or convert the i
mage format.

ple slices.
unsharp          Sharpen or blur the input video.
vflip            Flip the input video vertically.
buffer           Buffer video frames, and make them accessible to the filterchai
n.
color            Provide an uniformly colored input, syntax is: [color[:size[:ra
te]]]

For mobile applications (or more specifically non-web applications), it just seems wrong to leave the application (to go to a web-browser) for the authentication.  Additionally, there is no way (I am aware of) for the browser to return the callback to the application (especially cross-platform).  I know a couple of apps that do that, but it just feels wrong and gives a break in the application UX.</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<ol>
<li>User enters username/password into application.</li>
<li>Every API call is identified by the calling application.</li>
<li>Overhead is kept to a minimum and the auth aspect is intuitive for developers.</li>
<li>The mechanism is secure for both the end user (their login credentials are not exposed) as well as the developer (their application credentials are not exposed).</li>
<li>If possible, not require https (by no means a hard requirement).</li>
</ol>

<h3>My Current Thoughts on Implementation</h3>

<p>An external developer will request an API account.  They will receive an apikey and apisecret.  Every request will require at minimum three parameters.</p>

<ul>
<li>apikey - given to developer at regisration </li>
<li>timestamp - doubles as a unique identifier for each message for a given apikey</li>
<li>hash - a hash of the timestamp + the apisecret</li>
</ul>

<p>The apikey is required to identify the application issuing the request.  The timestamp acts similarly to the oauth_nonce and avoids/mitigates replay attacks.  The hash ensures that request was actually issued from the owner of the given apikey.</p>

<p>For authenticated requests (ones done on the behalf of a user), I'm still undecided between going with an access_token route or a username and password hash combo.  Either way, at some point a username/password combo will be required.  So when it does, a hash of several pieces of information (apikey, apisecret, timestamp) + the password would be used.  <b>I'd love feedback on this aspect.</b>  FYI, they would have to hash the password first, since I don't store the passwords in my system without hashing.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>FYI, this isn't a request for how to build/structure the API in general only how to handle the authentication and authorization from solely within an application.</p>

<h3>Random Thoughts/Bonus Questions</h3>

<p>For APIs that only require an apikey as part of the request, how do you prevent someone other than the apikey owner from being able to see the apikey (since sent in the clear) and make excessive requests to push them over usage limits?  Maybe I'm just over thinking this, but shouldn't there be something to authenticate that a request was verified to the apikey owner?  In my case, that was the purpose of the apisecret, it is never shown/transmitted without being hashed.</p>

<p>Speaking of hashes, what about md5 vs hmac-sha1?  Does it really matter when all of the values are hashed with with sufficiently long data (ie. apisecret)?</p>

<p>I had been previously considering adding a per user/row salt to my users password hash.  If I were to do that, how could the application be able to create a matching hash without knowing the salt used?</p>

"3975376","<p>While reading up the documentation for <code>dict.copy()</code>, it says that it makes a shallow copy of the dictionary. Same goes for the book I am following (Beazley's Python Reference), which says: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The m.copy() method makes a shallow
  copy of the items contained in a
  mapping object and places them in a
  new mapping object.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Consider this:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; original = dict(a=1, b=2)
&gt;&gt;&gt; new = original.copy()
&gt;&gt;&gt; new.update({'c': 3})
&gt;&gt;&gt; original
{'a': 1, 'b': 2}
&gt;&gt;&gt; new
{'a': 1, 'c': 3, 'b': 2}
</code></pre>

<p>So I assumed this would update the value of <code>original</code> (and add 'c': 3) also since I was doing a shallow copy. Like if you do it for a list:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; original = [1, 2, 3]
&gt;&gt;&gt; new = original
&gt;&gt;&gt; new.append(4)
&gt;&gt;&gt; new, original
([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4])
</code></pre>

<p>This works as expected.</p>

<p>Since both are shallow copies, why is that the <code>dict.copy()</code> doesn't work as I expect it to? Or my understanding of shallow vs deep copying is flawed?</p>

<p>I've got a consumer key and secret from Mendeley, and with DotNetOpenAuth I managed to get a browser launched with the Mendeley page providing a verification code for the user to enter into the application. However, at this point I got lost and couldn't work out how to sensibly provide that back to the application.</p>

<p><strong>Original post</strong>:</p>

<p>I want my node.js server to run in the background, i.e.: when I close my terminal I want my server to keep running. I've googled this and came up with this <a href=""http://kevin.vanzonneveld.net/techblog/article/run_nodejs_as_a_service_on_ubuntu_karmic/"" rel=""noreferrer"">tutorial</a>, however it doesn't work as intended. So instead of using that daemon script, I thought I just used the output redirection (the <code>2&gt;&amp;1 &gt;&gt; file</code> part), but this too does not exit - I get a blank line in my terminal, like it's waiting for output/errors.</p>

<p>I've also tried to put the process in the background, but as soon as I close my terminal the process is killed as well.</p>

<p>So how can I leave it running when I shut down my local computer?</p>

<p>Are nested functions not closures because they are not used by the external world?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> I was reading about closures and it got me thinking about this concept with respect to Python.

</ul>

<p>Basically those articles and recommendations says that to prevent the CSRF attack anybody should implement the following code:</p>

<p>1) Add the <code>[ValidateAntiForgeryToken]</code> on every action that accept the POST Http verb</p>

<pre><code>[HttpPost]
[ValidateAntiForgeryToken]
public ActionResult SomeAction( SomeModel model ) {
}
</code></pre>

<p>2) Add the <code>&lt;%= Html.AntiForgeryToken() %&gt;</code> helper inside forms that submits data to the server</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div style=""text-align:right; padding: 8px;""&gt;
    &lt;%= Html.AntiForgeryToken() %&gt;
    &lt;input type=""submit"" id=""btnSave"" value=""Save"" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Anyway in some parts of my app I am doing Ajax POSTs with jQuery to the server without having any form at all. This happens for example where I am letting the user to click on an image to do a specific action. </p>

<p>Suppose I have a table with a list of activities. I have an image on a column of the table that says ""Mark activity as completed"" and when the user click on that activity I am doing the Ajax POST as in the following sample:</p>

<pre><code>$(""a.markAsDone"").click(function (event) {
    event.preventDefault();
    $.ajax({
        type: ""post"",
        dataType: ""html"",
        url: $(this).attr(""rel""),
        data: {},
        success: function (response) {
            // ....
        }
    });
});
</code></pre>

<p>How can I use the <code>&lt;%= Html.AntiForgeryToken() %&gt;</code> in these cases? Should I include the helper call inside the data parameter of the Ajax call?</p>

<p>However, I have been unable to find a good explanation of the <strong>grammar</strong> of batch scripts, how things expand or do not expand, and how to escape things.</p>

<p>Here are sample questions that I have not been able to solve:</p>

<ul>
<li>How is the quote system managed? I made a <a href=""http://tinyperl.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""noreferrer"">TinyPerl</a> script<br>
( <code>foreach $i (@ARGV) { print '*' . $i ; }</code> ), compiled it and called it this way :

<ul>
<li><code>my_script.exe ""a """"b"""" c""</code> → output is  <code>*a ""b*c</code></li>
<li><code>my_script.exe """"""a b c""""""</code> → output it <code>*""a*b*c""</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>How does the internal <code>echo</code> command work? What is expanded inside that command?</li>
<li>Why do I have to use <code>for [...] %%I</code> in file scripts, but <code>for [...] %I</code> in interactive sessions?</li>
<li>What are the escape characters, and in what context? How to escape a percent sign? For example, how can I echo <code>%PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE%</code> literally? I found that <code>echo.exe %""""PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE%</code> works, is there a better solution?</li>
<li>How do pairs of <code>%</code> match? Example:

<ul>
<li><code>set b=a</code> , <code>echo %a %b% c%</code> → <code>%a a c%</code></li>
<li><code>set a =b</code>, <code>echo %a %b% c%</code> → <code>bb c%</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>How do I ensure a variable passes to a command as a single argument if ever this variable contains double quotes?</li>
<li>How are variables stored when using the <code>set</code> command? For example, if I do <code>set a=a"" b</code> and then <code>echo.%a%</code> I obtain <code>a"" b</code>. If I however use <code>echo.exe</code> from the UnxUtils, I get <code>a b</code>. How comes <code>%a%</code> expands in a different way?</li>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Well, obviously, there's no right answer to this question, but here's what I'm choosing to go with currently:</p>

<p>For unit testing, I used to use <a href=""http://www.sente.ch/software/ocunit/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">OCUnit/SenTestingKit</a> in XCode 4. It's simple &amp; solid. But, I prefer the language of BDD over TDD (<a href=""http://www.rubyinside.com/dhh-offended-by-rspec-debate-4610.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Why is RSpec better than Test::Unit</a>?) because our words create our world. So now, I use <a href=""https://github.com/allending/Kiwi/pull/42#issuecomment-1768713"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Kiwi with ARC</a> &amp; <a href=""https://github.com/allending/Kiwi/issues/30#issuecomment-1550718"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Kiwi code completion/autocompletion</a>. I prefer Kiwi over Cedar because it's built on top of OCUnit and comes with RSpec-style matchers &amp; mocks/stubs. UPDATE: I'm now looking into OCMock because, currently, <a href=""https://github.com/allending/Kiwi/issues/61"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Kiwi doesn't support stubbing toll-free bridged objects</a>.</p>

<p>For acceptance testing, I use UI Automation because it's awesome. It lets you record each test case, making writing tests automatic. Also, Apple develops it, and so it has a promising future. It also works on the device and from Instruments, which allows for other cool features, like showing memory leaks. Unfortunately, with UI Automation, I don't know how to run Objective-C code, but with Frank &amp; iCuke you can. So, I'll just test the lower-level Objective-C stuff with unit tests, or create <code>UIButton</code>s only for the <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6748087/xcode-test-vs-debug-preprocessor-macros/6763597#6763597""><code>TEST</code> build configuration</a>, which when clicked, will run Objective-C code.</p>

<p>Which solutions do you use?</p>

<p>Consider the following example:</p>

<p><div class=""snippet"" data-lang=""js"" data-hide=""false"" data-console=""true"" data-babel=""false"">
<div class=""snippet-code"">
<pre class=""snippet-code-js lang-js prettyprint-override""><code>var test = {
  val: 1,
  func: function() {
    return this.val;
  }
};
var testA = Object.create(test);

testA.val = 2;
console.log(test.func()); // 1
console.log(testA.func()); // 2

console.log('other test');
var otherTest = function() {
  this.val = 1;
  this.func = function() {
    return this.val;
  };
};

var otherTestA = new otherTest();
var otherTestB = new otherTest();
otherTestB.val = 2;
console.log(otherTestA.val); // 1 
console.log(otherTestB.val); // 2

console.log(otherTestA.func()); // 1
console.log(otherTestB.func()); // 2</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</p>

<p>Notice that the same behaviour is observed in both cases.  It seems to me that the primary differences between these two scenarios are:</p>

<ul>
<li>The object used in <code>Object.create()</code> actually forms the prototype of the new object, whereas in the <code>new Function()</code> from the declared properties/functions do not form the prototype.  </li>
<li>You cannot create closures with the <code>Object.create()</code> syntax as you would with the functional syntax.  This is logical given the lexical (vs block) type scope of JavaScript.</li>
</ul>

 'timestamp': timestamp,
 'address_book_id': 'id of the address book record'

"4200224","<p>As the GPU driver vendors don't usually bother to implement <code>noiseX</code> in GLSL, I'm looking for a <em>""graphics randomization swiss army knife""</em> utility function set, preferably optimised to use within GPU shaders. I prefer GLSL, but code any language will do for me, I'm ok with translating it on my own to GLSL.</p>

<p>Specifically, I'd expect:</p>

<p>a) <strong>Pseudo-random functions</strong> - N-dimensional, uniform distribution over [-1,1] or over [0,1], calculated from M-dimensional seed (ideally being any value, but I'm OK with having the seed restrained to, say, 0..1 for uniform result distribution). Something like:</p>

<pre><code>float random  (T seed);
vec2  random2 (T seed);
vec3  random3 (T seed);
vec4  random4 (T seed);
// T being either float, vec2, vec3, vec4 - ideally.
</code></pre>

<p>b) <strong>Continous noise</strong> like Perlin Noise - again, N-dimensional, +- uniform distribution, with constrained set of values and, well, looking good (some options to configure the appearance like Perlin levels could be useful too). I'd expect signatures like:</p>

<pre><code>float noise  (T coord, TT seed);
vec2  noise2 (T coord, TT seed);
// ...
</code></pre>

<p>I'm not very much into random number generation theory, so I'd most eagerly go for a <strong>pre-made solution</strong>, but I'd also appreciate answers like <em>""here's a very good, efficient 1D rand(), and let me explain you how to make a good N-dimensional rand() on top of it...""</em> .</p>

<ul>

</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/8x2uG.png"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>Obviously sticking everything into one big object isn't going to cut it, so I figured I needed to use classes instead of the current slew of functions. But even though I've read Learning Python's chapter about classes, I fail to apply it to my own code (<a href=""http://cloud.github.com/downloads/ivoflipse/DogsRus/pressureanalysis.py"" rel=""noreferrer"">GitHub link</a>)</p>

<p>I also feel like it's rather strange to process all the data <em>every</em> time I want to get out some information. Once I know the locations of each paw, there's no reason for me to calculate this again. Furthermore, I want to compare all the paws of the same dog to determine which contact belongs to which paw (front/hind, left/right). This would become a mess if I continue using only functions.</p>

<p>So now I'm looking for advice on how to create classes that will let me process my data (<a href=""http://dl.dropbox.com/u/5207386/Krupp_Krulle.rar"" rel=""noreferrer"">link to the zipped data of one dog</a>) in a sensible fashion. </p>

<p>I have read the other stackoverflow threads regarding <strong>Abstract Factory vs Factory Method</strong>. I understand the intent of each pattern. However, I am not clear on the definition.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Factory Method defines an interface
  for creating an object, but lets
  subclasses decide which of those to
  instantiate. A factory method lets
  classes defer instantiation to
  subclasses.</p>
  
  <p>By contrast, an Abstract Factory
  provides an interface for creating
  families of related or dependent
  objects without specifying their
  concrete classes.</p>

<p>This example allows you to start or stop a service directly, and separately bind/unbind from the service. When the service is running, it increments a number at 10&nbsp;Hz. If the activity is bound to the <code>Service</code>, it will display the current value. Data is transferred as an Integer and as a String so you can see how to do that two different ways. There are also buttons in the activity to send messages to the service (changes the increment-by value).</p>

(I recently added <a href=""http://packages.python.org/distribute/"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>distribute</code></a> to my toolbox because of <a href=""http://s3.pixane.com/pip_distribute.png"" rel=""noreferrer"">this Python public service announcement</a>. To install these two packages, I used:</p>
<pre><code>sudo pip install virtualenvwrapper
curl -O http://python-distribute.org/distribute_setup.py
sudo python distribute_setup.py
</code></pre>
<h2>No more setuptools and easy_install</h2>
<p>To really follow <a href=""http://s3.pixane.com/pip_distribute.png"" rel=""noreferrer"">that Python public service announcement</a>, on a fresh Python install, I would do the following:</p>
<pre><code>curl -O http://python-distribute.org/distribute_setup.py
sudo python distribute_setup.py
sudo easy_install pip
sudo pip install virtualenv
sudo pip install virtualenvwrapper
</code></pre>
<h2>Glyph's Rebuke</h2>
<p>In a comment to <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4314376/python-egg-file/4314446#4314446"">my answer</a> to <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4314376/python-egg-file"">SO question 4314376</a>, SO user <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/users/13564/glyph"">Glyph</a> stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>NO. NEVER EVER do <code>sudo python setup.py install</code> whatever. Write a ~/.pydistutils.cfg that puts your pip installation into ~/.local or something. Especially files named <code>ez_setup.py</code> tend to suck down newer versions of things like setuptools and easy_install, which can potentially break other things on your operating system.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Back to the short question</h2>
<p>So <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4314376/python-egg-file/4314446#4314446"">Glyph's response</a> leads me to my original question:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the proper way to install <a href=""http://pip.readthedocs.org"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>pip</code></a>, <a href=""http://virtualenv.openplans.org/"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>virtualenv</code></a>, and <a href=""http://packages.python.org/distribute/"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>distribute</code></a>?</li>

"4325639","<p>I am trying to call some <code>javascript</code> functions sitting in an <code>html</code> page running inside an <code>android webview</code>.  Pretty simple what the code tries to do below - from the android app, call a <code>javascript</code> function with a test message, which inturn calls a java function back in the android app that displays test message via toast.</p>

<p>The <code>javascript</code> function looks like:</p>

<pre><code>function testEcho(message){
     window.JSInterface.doEchoTest(message);
}
</code></pre>

<p>From the WebView, I have tried calling the <code>javascript</code> the following ways with no luck:</p>

<pre><code>myWebView.loadUrl(""javascript:testEcho(Hello World!)"");
mWebView.loadUrl(""javascript:(function () { "" + ""testEcho(Hello World!);"" + ""})()"");
</code></pre>

<p>I did enable <code>javascript</code> on the <code>WebView</code></p>

<pre><code>myWebView.getSettings().setJavaScriptEnabled(true);
// register class containing methods to be exposed to JavaScript
myWebView.addJavascriptInterface(myJSInterface, ""JSInterface""); 
</code></pre>

<p>And heres the <code>Java</code> Class</p>

<pre><code>public class JSInterface{

private WebView mAppView;
public JSInterface  (WebView appView) {
        this.mAppView = appView;
    }

    public void doEchoTest(String echo){
        Toast toast = Toast.makeText(mAppView.getContext(), echo, Toast.LENGTH_SHORT);
        toast.show();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I've spent a lot of time googling around to see what I may be doing wrong.  All examples I have found use this approach.  Does anyone see something wrong here?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong>  There are several other external <code>javascript</code> files being referenced &amp; used in the <code>html</code>, could they be the issue?</p>

<li><p>If I use the same one, is it as simple as clearing the FRC cache and then changing the predicate in the handleSearchForTerm:searchString method?  Does the predicate have to contain the initial predicate as well as the search terms or does it remember that it used a predicate to retrieve data in the first place?</p></li>
<li><p>How do I get back to the original results?  Do I just set the search predicate to nil?  Won't that kill the original predicate that was used to retrieve the FRC results in the first place?</p></li>

"4485059","<p>I've been using Git on both Windows and Ubuntu during the development of a small project, frequently flipping back and forth between the two. The issue is that <em>Git Bash</em> consistently becomes slow.</p>

<p>When I say slow, I mean that running <code>cd</code> takes anywhere from 8-25 seconds, running <code>git</code> commands take from 5-20 seconds, and <code>ls</code> can take up to 30 seconds sometimes. Needless to say, this is not fun, not to mention unproductive. I know Git is slower on Windows, but this is ridiculous.</p>

<p>The one solution which has worked--temporarily--for me has been to disable my network connection (as suggested in <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2835775/msysgit-bash-is-horrendously-slow-in-windows-7"">this answer</a>), start Git Bash, and then reconnect. Sometimes it continues to run quickly for days after doing that, but the performance always degrades eventually. I've trawled through the msysgit discussion group, Stack&nbsp;Overflow, msysgit issue list, etc. on and off for weeks, but I haven't been able to turn up solutions which work.</p>

<p>So far, I've tried:</p>

<ul>
<li>Adding Git &amp; project folders to the virus scanner's exclusion list</li>
<li>Disabling my virus scanner completely (Kaspersky IS 2011)</li>
<li>Ensuring that Outlook is not running (Outlook 2007)</li>
<li>Shutting down all other applications</li>
<li>Running Git Bash as administrator</li>
<li>Disabling network connection, starting Git Bash, and keeping connection disabled</li>
<li>Disabling network connection, starting Git Bash, re-enabling connection (works only occasionally)</li>
<li>Running <code>git gc</code></li>
<li>And combinations of the above</li>
</ul>

<p>I did read that a couple of people had success disabling Bash completion, but ideally I'd like to keep that active. The version of msysgit is 1.7.3.1-preview20101002 &amp; the OS is Windows 7 x64. Running the same things on Linux is, predictably, lightning fast. I would use Linux exclusively, but I need to run stuff in Windows, too (certain applications, testing, etc.).</p>

<p>Has anyone encountered a similar issue? If so, what was the underlying problem and what was the solution (if any)?</p>

<p>This extends beyond just the Git repositories, but just for reference, the repositories I've been using Git with have been pretty small: ~4-50 files maximum.</p>

"4574868","<p>I have a product with a straightforward REST API so that users of the product can directly integrate with the product's features without using my web user interface.</p>

<p>Recently I have been getting interest from various third parties about integrating their desktop clients with the API to allow users of my product to access their data using that third party application.</p>

<p>I've seen that applications that want to use Twitter authenticate using a login page hosted by Twitter that grants a specific application permission to access that user's data. You click the ""Allow"" or ""Deny"" button and the authentication process is complete. Facebook uses the same mechanism as best I can tell.</p>

<p>Upon further research, this seems to be OAuth in action, and seeing as my API is .Net-based, I am thinking I should use DotNetOpenAuth and provide a similar mechanism. Unfortunately the samples are sparsely documented (if at all) and the only tutorials I can find online seem to be focussed on helping you provide a login mechanism for your users so that they can log into your website using a third party provider.</p>

<p>What I would <em>really</em> like to do is have my REST API handle all of the core authentication and business logic for my web application and have, under the hood, my web application essentially be another application that just uses the API via OAuth. Users would authenticate on the website either directly using their username and password, or via a third party provider such as MyOpenID or Facebook and then the website would somehow use the returned token to authenticate against the REST API.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/neKuF.png"" alt=""Architectural Diagram""></p>

<p>It basically looks like I need my API to somehow host an OAuth service, but also have users use a third party OAuth service. I can't help but think I don't quite have enough of a grasp on OAuth to decide if I'm overcomplicating things or if what I'm trying to do is a good or bad way to do things.</p>

<p>Can someone give me at least a broad overview of the steps I need to undertake, or what I should look at to make this happen? Or point me at some tutorials? Or blast my proposal and tell me I'm going about this (architecturally) all wrong?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""applies to situations in which there needs to be a single instance of a class.""  </p>

<p>According to the example in the manual, we should do this:</p>

<pre><code>class Database {
    private static $instance, $db;

    private function __construct(){}

    static function singleton() {
        if(!isset(self::$instance))
            self::$instance = new __CLASS__;

    $db = Database::singleton();
    $db-&gt;get()-&gt;query('...');
}

some_function();
</code></pre>

<p>Why do I need that relatively large class when I can do this?</p>

<pre><code>class Database {

"4623974","<p><strong>Goal:</strong>
Allow a user to authentication with Facebook into an iOS application which requires access to a protected web service that I'm running.</p>

<p><strong>Assumptions:</strong>
There is a native authentication (and registration) system in place for those users that opt not to use Facebook for sign in.</p>

<p><strong>Details:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Assume we want to offer the option for a user to sign in with Facebook without creating a separate account/credential for our system.</li>
<li>Because we support our own native auth mechanism (username and password) we have our own user IDs and issue an authentication token that is used for subsequent interactions after the initial credential validation.</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm surprised that Facebook doesn't have best practices for this in their developer documentation. All the existing documentation is either assuming you are building FB auth into a website, or a standalone mobile app with no service that requires authentication.</p>

<p>Here's my initial thoughts on how this would be designed but want validation on whether it's correct. </p>

<ol>
<li>Client pops the Facebook iOS Login</li>
<li>UI User signs in with Facebook credentials and gets access token</li>
<li>iOS App passes access token to our server</li>
<li><p>Our server talks to FB graph API using access token to (a) validate the token and (b) get the FB user ID for that access token. </p>

<p>e.g. Our server would call <a href=""https://graph.facebook.com/me/?access_token=XYZ"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://graph.facebook.com/me/?access_token=XYZ</a> which would return profile info in a JSON object</p></li>
<li><p>Assuming it's valid, our server extracts the User ID from the JSON object and checks whether the user already has an account. If so, we issue our own auth ticket to client to use for that session.  If user doesn't have an account, we create a new one with the Facebook User ID, assign our own unique UserID and issue our auth ticket.</p></li>
<li>Client then passes auth ticket back on subsequent interactions that need authentication.</li>
</ol>

<p>This seems like the right approach to me but not sure if I'm missing something insanely basic and going down the wrong (complicated) path.</p>

<p>When a long-running Python script (e.g, web application) is started from within the ssh session and backgounded, and the ssh session is closed, the application will raise IOError and fail the moment it tries to write to stdout.

Currently, I employ nohup to redirect output to a file, and that gets the job done, but I was wondering if there was a way to do it without using nohup, out of curiosity.</p>

<p>I have already tried <code>sys.stdout = open('somefile', 'w')</code>, but this does not seem to prevent some external modules from still outputting to terminal (or maybe the <code>sys.stdout = ...</code> line did not fire at all).

"4709137","<p>The <code>INSTALL_FAILED_INSUFFICIENT_STORAGE</code> error is the bane of every Android developer's life. It happens regardless of app size, or how much storage is available. Rebooting the target device fixes the problem briefly, but it soon comes back. There are hundreds (if not thousands) of message board posts from people asking why the problem occurs, but the folks at Google are frustratingly silent on the issue.</p>

<p>There is a simple workaround. If your test device is running Android 2.2 or later then add the <code>android:installLocation</code> attribute to your application's manifest file, with the value <code>""preferExternal""</code>. This will force the app to be installed on the device's external storage, such as a phone's SD card.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;manifest xmlns:android=""http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android""
          package=""com.andrewsmith.android.darkness""
          android:installLocation=""preferExternal""
</code></pre>

<p>This is more of a band-aid than a fix, and it may not be ideal if you want your finished app to install on the device's internal memory. But it will at least make the development process a lot less frustrating.</p>

"4769020","<p>Which XMPP library would be the best choice nowadays for Android development?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I've been using the <strong><a href=""http://davanum.wordpress.com/2008/12/29/updated-xmpp-client-for-android/"">patched Smack
library</a></strong> as is
suggested in many other questions
here in SO. However, that's a patched version of
the Smack API from two years ago. And
although it generally works well I'm
exploring any other, more recent
options.</p></li>
<li><p>I've been looking at the <strong><a href=""http://www.igniterealtime.org/projects/smack/"">official
Smack API</a></strong> and after a little
research, it seems it might work just
fine nowadays (although I have not
tried it yet in a real application).</p></li>
<li><p>There's also another solution I came
across, <strong><a href=""http://www.beem-project.com/projects/beem/files"">Beem's aSMACK library</a></strong>.
Beem is a fairly new XMPP client for
android and from what I understand
they are using their own patched
version of aSMACK.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, there's <strong><a href=""http://code.google.com/p/asmack/"">aSMACK</a></strong> but that
too hasn't been updated for quite
some time (as the site suggests).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Do you have any other suggestions or can you explain why I should choose one of the above over the rest?</p>

<p>Of course, I could do a <code>$(""body"").css(""overflow"", ""hidden"");</code> and then put it back to auto when the animation stops, but it would be better if the scrollbar was still visible but inactive.</p>

"4770297","<p>I've never had to convert time to and from UTC. Recently had a request to have my app be timezone aware, and I've been running myself in circles. Lots of information on converting local time to UTC, which I found fairly elementary (maybe I'm doing that wrong as well), but I can not find any information on easily converting the UTC time to the end-users timezone.</p>

<p>In a nutshell, and android app sends me (appengine app) data and within that data is a timestamp. To store that timestamp to utc time I am using:</p>

<pre><code>datetime.utcfromtimestamp(timestamp)
</code></pre>

<p>That seems to be working. When my app stores the data, it is being store as 5 hours ahead (I am EST -5)</p>

<p>The data is being stored on appengine's BigTable, and when retrieved it comes out as a string like so: </p>

<pre><code>""2011-01-21 02:37:21""
</code></pre>

<p>How do I convert this string to a DateTime in the users correct time zone?</p>

<p>Also, what is the recommended storage for a users timezone information?  (How do you typically store tz info ie: ""-5:00"" or ""EST"" etc etc ?) I'm sure the answer to my first question might contain a parameter the answers the second.  </p>

"4774054","<p>I have a Bash script that needs to know its full path. I'm trying to find a broadly-compatible way of doing that without ending up with relative or funky-looking paths. I only need to support Bash, not sh, csh, etc.</p>

<p>What I've found so far:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The accepted answer to <em><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59895/can-a-bash-script-tell-what-directory-its-stored-in"">Getting the source directory of a Bash script from within</a></em> addresses getting the path of the script via <code>dirname $0</code>, which is fine, but that may return a <em>relative</em> path (like <code>.</code>), which is a problem if you want to change directories in the script and have the path still point to the script's directory. Still, <code>dirname</code> will be part of the puzzle.</p></li>
<li><p>The accepted answer to <em><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3572030/bash-script-absolute-path-with-osx"">Bash script absolute path with OS X</a></em> <em>(OS X specific, but the answer works regardless)</em> gives a function that will test to see if <code>$0</code> looks relative and if so will pre-pend <code>$PWD</code> to it. But the result can still have relative bits in it (although overall it's absolute)&nbsp;&mdash; for instance, if the script is <code>t</code> in the directory <code>/usr/bin</code> and you're in <code>/usr</code> and you type <code>bin/../bin/t</code> to run it (yes, that's convoluted), you end up with <code>/usr/bin/../bin</code> as the script's directory path. Which <strong>works</strong>, but...</p></li>
<li><p>The <code>readlink</code> solution <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20110620064726/http://fritzthomas.com/open-source/linux/384-how-to-get-the-absolute-path-within-the-running-bash-script/"" rel=""noreferrer"">on this page</a>, which looks like this:</p>

<pre><code># Absolute path to this script. /home/user/bin/foo.sh
SCRIPT=$(readlink -f $0)
# Absolute path this script is in. /home/user/bin
SCRIPTPATH=`dirname $SCRIPT`
</code></pre>

<p>But <code>readlink</code> isn't POSIX and apparently the solution relies on GNU's <code>readlink</code> where BSD's won't work for some reason (I don't have access to a BSD-like system to check).</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So, various ways of doing it, but they all have their caveats.</p>

<p>What would be a better way? Where ""better"" means:</p>

<ul>
<li>Gives me the absolute path.</li>
<li>Takes out funky bits even when invoked in a convoluted way (see comment on #2 above). (E.g., at least moderately canonicalizes the path.)</li>
<li>Relies only on Bash-isms or things that are almost certain to be on most popular flavors of *nix systems (GNU/Linux, BSD and BSD-like systems like OS&nbsp;X, etc.).</li>
<li>Avoids calling external programs if possible (e.g., prefers Bash built-ins).</li>
<li>(<strong>Updated</strong>, thanks for the heads up, <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/users/251414/wich"">wich</a>) It doesn't have to resolve symlinks (in fact, I'd kind of prefer it left them alone, but that's not a requirement).</li>

"4782543","<p>I'm writing this in mere desperation :) I've been assigned to make a standalone barcode scanner (as a proof of concept) to an Android 1.6 phone.</p>

<p>For this i've discovered the ZXing library.</p>

<p>I've googled, read related topics here on StackOverflow used common sence and so forth. Nothing seemed to have helped, and i just can't punch a hole on this mentale blockade :/</p>

<p>I know it to be possible, to use the lib, and create your own standalone barcode scanner. I've read that using the ""Barcode Scanner"" provided by the Zxing folks, is by far the easiest solution (via Intent). Unfortunately this is not an option, and a standalone app is desired.</p>

<p>So to sum up my problem :</p>

<ol>
<li>How to integrate ZXing source lib into my Android Code project through Eclipse?</li>
<li>When integrated ... how to make use of the lib, to ""load"" the scanning function?</li>
<li>A step to step guide is almost prefered because i just started working in Eclipse.</li>
</ol>

<p>I've tried to make my code project dependant of the Android folder from the ZXing source folder. When i do so, a handfull errors emerge, mostly concerning 'org.apache' (??)</p>

<p>I just can't figure it out ... so a few hints would be most helpfull.</p>

"4814167","<p>I am creating a system which polls devices for data on varying metrics such as CPU utilisation, disk utilisation, temperature etc. at (probably) 5 minute intervals using SNMP. The ultimate goal is to provide visualisations to a user of the system in the form of time-series graphs.</p>

<p>I have looked at using RRDTool in the past, but rejected it as storing the captured data indefinitely is important to my project, and I want higher level and more flexible access to the captured data. So my question is really:</p>

<p><em>What is better, a relational database (such as MySQL or PostgreSQL) or a non-relational or NoSQL database (such as MongoDB or Redis) with regard to performance when querying data for graphing.</em></p>

<h2>Relational</h2>

<p>Given a relational database, I would use a <code>data_instances</code> table, in which would be stored every instance of data captured for every metric being measured for all devices, with the following fields:</p>

<p>Fields: <code>id</code> <code>fk_to_device</code> <code>fk_to_metric</code> <code>metric_value</code> <code>timestamp</code></p>

<p>When I want to draw a graph for a particular metric on a particular device, I must query this singular table <em>filtering out</em> the other devices, and the other metrics being analysed for this device:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT metric_value, timestamp FROM data_instances
    WHERE fk_to_device=1 AND fk_to_metric=2
</code></pre>

<p>The number of rows in this table would be:</p>

<pre><code>d * m_d * f * t
</code></pre>

<p>where <code>d</code> is the number of <strong>devices</strong>, <code>m_d</code> is the accumulative <strong>number of metrics</strong> being recorded for all devices, <code>f</code> is the <strong>frequency</strong> at which data is polled for and <code>t</code> is the total amount of <strong>time</strong> the system has been collecting data.</p>

<p>For a user recording 10 metrics for 3 devices every 5 minutes for a year, we would have just under <strong>5 million</strong> records. </p>

<h3>Indexes</h3>

<p>Without indexes on <code>fk_to_device</code> and <code>fk_to_metric</code> scanning this continuously expanding table would take too much time. So indexing the aforementioned fields and also <code>timestamp</code> (for creating graphs with localised periods) is a requirement.</p>

<h2>Non-Relational (NoSQL)</h2>

<p>MongoDB has the concept of a <em>collection</em>, unlike tables these can be created programmatically without setup. With these I could partition the storage of data for each device, or even each metric recorded for each device.</p>

<p>I have no experience with NoSQL and do not know if they provide any query performance enhancing features such as indexing, however the previous paragraph proposes doing most of the traditional relational query work in the structure by which the data is stored under NoSQL.</p>

<h2>Undecided</h2>

<p>Would a relational solution with correct indexing reduce to a crawl within the year? Or does the collection based structure of NoSQL approaches (which matches my mental model of the stored data) provide a noticeable benefit?</p>

<hr>

<p>I would like to have a single template that once and for all takes care of pretty-printing all STL containers via <code>operator&lt;&lt;</code>. In pseudo code, I'm looking for something like this:</p>

<pre><code>template&lt;container C, class T, String delim = "", "", String open = ""["", String close = ""]""&gt;
std::ostream &amp; operator&lt;&lt;(std::ostream &amp; o, const C&lt;T&gt; &amp; x)
{
    o &lt;&lt; open;
    // for (typename C::const_iterator i = x.begin(); i != x.end(); i++) /* Old-school */
    for (auto i = x.begin(); i != x.end(); i++)
    {
        if (i != x.begin()) o &lt;&lt; delim;
        o &lt;&lt; *i;
    }
    o &lt;&lt; close;
    return o;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now I've seen plenty of template magic here on SO that I never thought possible, so I'm wondering if anyone can suggest something that would match all containers C. Maybe something trait-ish that can figure out if something has the necessary iterator?</p>

<p>Many thanks!</p>

<p><strong>Update (and solution)</strong></p>

<p>After raising this problem again on <a href=""http://channel9.msdn.com/Forums/TechOff/Templated-STL-container-pretty-printer"" rel=""noreferrer"">Channel 9</a>, I got a fantastic answer from Sven Groot, which, combined with a bit of SFINAE type traiting, appears to solve the problem in a completely general and nestable fashion. The delimiters may be individually specialised, an example specialization for std::set is included, as well as an example of using custom delimiters.</p>

<p>The helper ""wrap_array()"" can be used to print raw C arrays. <em>Update:</em> Pairs and tuples are available for printing; default delimiters are round brackets.</p>

<p>The enable-if type trait requires C++0x, but with some modifications it should be possible to make a C++98 version of this. Tuples require variadic templates, hence C++0x.</p>

<p>I have asked Sven to post the solution here so that I can accept it, but in the meantime I'd like to post the code myself for reference. (<em>Update:</em> Sven has now posted his code below, which I made the accepted answer. My own code uses container type traits, which work for me but may cause unexpected behaviour with non-container classes that provide iterators.)</p>

<ul>
<li><s>Implement output for <code>std::tuple&lt;...&gt;</code> in the same way is we have it for <code>std::pair&lt;S,T&gt;</code>.</s> <em>Update:</em> This is now a <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6245735/pretty-print-stdtuple"">separate question on SO</a>! <em>Upupdate:</em> This has now been implemented, thanks to Xeo!</li>
<li><s>Add namespaces so that the helper classes don't bleed into the global namespace.</s> <em>Done</em></li>
<li>Add template aliases (or something similar) to facilitate making custom delimiter classes, or maybe preprocessor macros?</li>

<p><em>Recent updates:</em></p>

<ul>
<li>I removed the custom output iterator in favour of a simple for loop in the print function.</li>
<li>All implementation details are now in the <code>pretty_print</code> namespace. Only the global stream operators and the <code>pretty_print_array</code> wrapper are in the global namespace.</li>
<li>Fixed the namespacing so that <code>operator&lt;&lt;</code> is now correctly in <code>std</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Notes:</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Removing the output iterator means that there is no way to use <code>std::copy()</code> to get pretty-printing. I might reinstate the pretty iterator if this is a desired feature, but Sven's code below has the implementation.</li>
<li>It was a conscious design decision to make the delimiters compile-time constants rather than object constants. That means that you cannot supply delimiters dynamically at runtime, but it also means that there's no unneeded overhead. An object-based delimiter configuration has been proposed by Dennis Zickefoose in a comment to Sven's code below. If desired, this could be implemented as an alternative feature.</li>
<li>It is currently not obvious how to customize nested container delimiters.</li>
<li>Bear in mind that the purpose of this library is to allow <em>quick</em> container printing facilities that require <em>zero coding</em> on your part. It is not an all-purpose formatting library, but rather a developing tool to alleviate the need to write boiler-plate code for container inspection.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Thank you to everyone who contributed!</em></p>

<hr>

<p><em>Note:</em> If you are looking for a quick way to deploy custom delimiters, here is one way using type erasure. We assume that you have already constructed a delimiter class, say <code>MyDel</code>, like so:</p>

<pre><code>struct MyDel { static const pretty_print::delimiters_values&lt;char&gt; values; };
const pretty_print::delimiters_values&lt;char&gt; MyDel::values = { ""&lt;"", ""; "", ""&gt;"" };
</code></pre>

<p>Now we want to be able to write <code>std::cout &lt;&lt; MyPrinter(v) &lt;&lt; std::endl;</code> for some container <code>v</code> using those delimiters. <code>MyPrinter</code> will be a type-erasing class, like so:</p>

<pre><code>struct wrapper_base
{
  virtual ~wrapper_base() { }
  virtual std::ostream &amp; stream(std::ostream &amp; o) = 0;
};

template &lt;typename T, typename Delims&gt;
struct wrapper : public wrapper_base
{
  wrapper(const T &amp; t) : t(t) { }
  std::ostream &amp; stream(std::ostream &amp; o)
  {
    return o &lt;&lt; pretty_print::print_container_helper&lt;T, char, std::char_traits&lt;char&gt;, Delims&gt;(t);
  }
private:
  const T &amp; t;
};

template &lt;typename Delims&gt;
struct MyPrinter
{
  template &lt;typename Container&gt; MyPrinter(const Container &amp; c) : base(new wrapper&lt;Container, Delims&gt;(c)) { }
  ~MyPrinter() { delete base; }
  wrapper_base * base;
};

template &lt;typename Delims&gt;

<p>After using this syntax liberally in my js files, I ran one of the files through <a href=""http://www.jslint.com/"" rel=""noreferrer"">jsLint</a>, and it freaked out:</p>

<p>After reading through <a href=""http://www.jslint.com/lint.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">jsLint's explanation of its behavior</a>, it looks like jsLint doesn't really like the <code>new Array()</code> syntax, and instead prefers <code>[]</code> when declaring arrays.</p>

<p>So I have a couple questions:</p>

<p>First, why?  Am I running any risk by using the <code>new Array()</code> syntax instead?  Are there browser incompatibilities that I should be aware of?</p>

<p>And second, if I switch to the square bracket syntax, is there any way to declare an array and set its length all on one line, or do I have to do something like this:</p>

"4852251","<p>Software Engineering as it is taught today is entirely focused on object-oriented programming and the 'natural' object-oriented view of the world. There is a detailed methodology that describes how to transform a domain model into a class model with several steps and a lot of (UML) artifacts like use-case-diagrams or class-diagrams. Many programmers have internalized this approach and have a good idea about how to design an object-oriented application from scratch. </p>

<p>The new hype is functional programming, which is taught in many books and tutorials. But what about functional software engineering? 
While reading about Lisp and Clojure, I came about two interesting statements: </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Functional programs are often developed bottom up instead of top down ('On Lisp', Paul Graham)</p></li>
<li><p>Functional Programmers use Maps where OO-Programmers use objects/classes ('Clojure for Java Programmers', talk by Rich Hickley). </p></li>
</ol>

<p>So what is the methodology for a systematic (model-based ?) design of a functional application, i.e. in Lisp or Clojure? What are the common steps, what artifacts do I use, how do I map them from the problem space to the solution space? </p>

"4856255","<p>I was looking to find the difference between these four on Google and I expected there to be a huge amount of information on this, but there really wasn't any solid comparison between the four calls.</p>
<p>I set about trying to compile a kind of basic at-a-glance look at the differences between these system calls and here's what I got. Is all this information correct/am I missing anything important ?</p>
<p><code>Fork</code> : The fork call basically makes a duplicate of the current process, identical in almost every way (not everything is copied over, for example, resource limits in some implementations but the idea is to create as close a copy as possible).</p>
<p>The new process (child) gets a different process ID (PID) and has the PID of the old process (parent) as its parent PID (PPID). Because the two processes are now running exactly the same code, they can tell which is which by the return code of fork - the child gets 0, the parent gets the PID of the child. This is all, of course, assuming the fork call works - if not, no child is created and the parent gets an error code.</p>
<p><code>Vfork</code> : The basic difference between vfork and fork is that when a new process is created with vfork(), the parent process is temporarily suspended, and the child process might borrow the parent's address space. This strange state of affairs continues until the child process either exits, or calls execve(), at which point the parent
process continues.</p>
<p>This means that the child process of a vfork() must be careful to avoid unexpectedly modifying variables of the parent process. In particular, the child process must not return from the function containing the vfork() call, and it must not call exit() (if it needs to exit, it should use _exit(); actually, this is also true for the child of a normal fork()).</p>
<p><code>Exec :</code> The exec call is a way to basically replace the entire current process with a new program. It loads the program into the current process space and runs it from the entry point. exec() replaces the current process with a the executable pointed by the function. Control never returns to the original program unless there is an exec() error.</p>
<p><code>Clone :</code> Clone, as fork, creates a new process. Unlike fork, these calls allow the child process to share parts of its execution context with the calling process, such as the memory space, the table of file descriptors, and the table of signal handlers.</p>
<p>When the child process is created with clone, it executes the function application fn(arg). (This differs from fork, where execution continues in the child from the point of the original fork call.) The fn argument is a pointer to a function that is called by the child process at the beginning of its execution. The arg argument is passed to the fn function.</p>
<p>When the fn(arg) function application returns, the child process terminates. The integer returned by fn is the exit code for the child process. The child process may also terminate explicitly by calling exit(2) or after receiving a fatal signal.</p>

db.addUser('theadmin', '12345');
db.auth('theadmin','12345');
</code></pre>

<p>After that, I exited and ran mongo again.  And I don't need password to access it. Even if I connect to the database remotely, I am not prompted for user name &amp; password. </p>

<hr>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong> Here is the solution I ended up using</p>

<pre><code>1) At the mongo command line, set the administrator:

    use admin;
    db.addUser('admin','123456');

2) Shutdown the server and exit

    db.shutdownServer();
    exit

3) Restart mongod with --auth

  $ sudo ./mongodb/bin/mongod --auth --dbpath /mnt/db/

4) Run mongo again in 2 ways:

   i) run mongo first then login:

        $ ./mongodb/bin/mongo localhost:27017
        use admin
        db.auth('admin','123456');

  ii) run &amp; login to mongo in command line.

        $ ./mongodb/bin/mongo localhost:27017/admin -u admin -p 123456
</code></pre>

<p>The username &amp; password will work the same way for <code>mongodump</code> and <code>mongoexport</code>.</p>

<p>I've managed to do it with the telnet command, and it works fine when the port is opened, but it doesn't seem to timeout when it's not and just hangs there...</p>

if [ ""$?"" -ne 0 ]; then
  echo ""Connection to $SERVER on port $PORT failed""
  exit 1
else
  echo ""Connection to $SERVER on port $PORT succeeded""
  exit 0

  <p>In hit-testing, a window calls <code>hitTest:withEvent:</code> on the top-most view of the view hierarchy; this method proceeds by recursively calling <code>pointInside:withEvent:</code> on each view in the view hierarchy that returns YES, proceeding down the hierarchy until it finds the subview within whose bounds the touch took place. That view becomes the hit-test view.</p>

<p>So is it like that only <code>hitTest:withEvent:</code> of the top-most view is called by the system, which calls <code>pointInside:withEvent:</code> of all of subviews, and if the return from a specific subview is YES, then calls <code>pointInside:withEvent:</code> of that subview's subclasses?</p>

Moreover, why is <code>getApplication</code> defined on <code>Activity</code> and <code>Service</code>, but not on <code>Context</code>?

"5020704","<p>I'm currently designing and implementing a RESTful API in PHP. However, I have been unsuccessful implementing my initial design.</p>

<pre><code>GET /users # list of users
GET /user/1 # get user with id 1
POST /user # create new user
PUT /user/1 # modify user with id 1
DELETE /user/1 # delete user with id 1
</code></pre>

<p>So far pretty standard, right?</p>

<p>My problem is with the first one <code>GET /users</code>. I was considering sending parameters in the request body to filter the list. This is because I want to be able to specify complex filters without getting a super long url, like:</p>

<pre><code>GET /users?parameter1=value1&amp;parameter2=value2&amp;parameter3=value3&amp;parameter4=value4
</code></pre>

<p>Instead I wanted to have something like:</p>

<pre><code>GET /users
# Request body:
{
    ""parameter1"": ""value1"",
    ""parameter2"": ""value2"",
    ""parameter3"": ""value3"",
    ""parameter4"": ""value4""
}
</code></pre>

<p>which is much more readable and gives you great possibilities to set complex filters.</p>

<p>Anyway, <code>file_get_contents('php://input')</code> didn't return the request body for <code>GET</code> requests. I also tried <code>http_get_request_body()</code>, but the shared hosting that I'm using doesn't have <code>pecl_http</code>. Not sure it would have helped anyway.</p>

<p>I found <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/978061/http-get-with-request-body"">this question</a> and realized that GET probably isn't supposed to have a request body. It was a bit inconclusive, but they advised against it. </p>

<p><strong>So now I'm not sure what to do. How do you design a RESTful search/filtering function?</strong></p>

Most (if not all) of them depend on Hibernate, but I'd like to discuss them JPA-implementation-neutrally (I am using EclipseLink, by the way).</p>

<p>All possible implementations are having their own <strong>advantages</strong> and <strong>disadvantages</strong> regarding:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><code>hashCode()</code>/<code>equals()</code></strong> contract <strong>conformity</strong> (immutability) for <code>List</code>/<code>Set</code> operations</li>
<li>Whether <strong>identical</strong> objects (e.g. from different sessions, dynamic proxies from lazily-loaded data structures) can be detected</li>
<li>Whether entities behave correctly in <strong>detached (or non-persisted) state</strong> 
<br></li>
</ul>

<p>As far I can see, there are <strong>three options</strong>: </p>

<ol>
<li>Do not override them; rely on <code>Object.equals()</code> and <code>Object.hashCode()</code>

<ul>
<li><code>hashCode()</code>/<code>equals()</code> work</li>
<li>cannot identify identical objects, problems with dynamic proxies</li>
<li>no problems with detached entities</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Override them, based on the <strong>primary key</strong>

<ul>
<li><code>hashCode()</code>/<code>equals()</code> are broken</li>
<li>correct identity (for all managed entities)</li>
<li>problems with detached entities</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Override them, based on the <strong>Business-Id</strong> (non-primary key fields; what about foreign keys?)

<ul>
<li><code>hashCode()</code>/<code>equals()</code> are broken</li>
<li>correct identity (for all managed entities)</li>
<li>no problems with detached entities</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>My questions are:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Did I miss an option and/or pro/con point?<br></li>
<li>What option did you choose and why?</li>
</ol>

<p><br><br>
<strong>UPDATE 1:</strong></p>

<p>By ""<code>hashCode()</code>/<code>equals()</code> are broken"", I mean that successive <code>hashCode()</code> invocations may return differing values, which is (when correctly implemented) not broken in the sense of the <code>Object</code> API documentation, but which causes problems when trying to retrieve a changed entity from a <code>Map</code>,  <code>Set</code> or other hash-based <code>Collection</code>.  Consequently, JPA implementations (at least EclipseLink) will not work correctly in some cases.</p>

<p>I've seen a few cases on StackOverflow where auto resizing was needed, but they are either very special cases with hack solutions, have no solution, or involve re-drawing the <code>TextView</code> recursively until it is small enough (which is memory intense and forces the user to watch the text shrink step-by-step with every recursion). </p>

"5035132","<p>I have been working on a method to sync core data stored in an iPhone application between multiple devices, such as an iPad or a Mac. There are not many (if any at all) sync frameworks for use with Core Data on iOS. However, I have been thinking about the following concept:</p>

<ol>
<li>A change is made to the local core data store, and the change is saved. (a) If the device is online, it tries to send the changeset to the server, including the device ID of the device which sent the changeset. (b) If the changeset does not reach the server, or if the device is not online, the app will add the change set to a queue to send when it does come online.</li>
<li>The server, sitting in the cloud, merges the specific change sets it receives with its master database.</li>
<li>After a change set (or a queue of change sets) is merged on the cloud server, the server pushes all of those change sets to the other devices registered with the server using some sort of polling system. (I thought to use Apple's Push services, but apparently according to the comments this is not a workable system.)</li>
</ol>

<p>Is there anything fancy that I need to be thinking about? I have looked at REST frameworks such as <a href=""http://iphoneonrails.com/"" rel=""noreferrer"">ObjectiveResource</a>, <a href=""http://coreresource.org/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Core Resource</a>, and <a href=""https://github.com/lukeredpath/RestfulCoreData"" rel=""noreferrer"">RestfulCoreData</a>. Of course, these are all working with Ruby on Rails, which I am not tied to, but it's a place to start. The main requirements I have for my solution are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Any changes should be sent in the background without pausing the main thread.</li>
<li>It should use as little bandwidth as possible.</li>
</ol>

<p>I have thought about a number of the challenges:</p>

<ol>
<li>Making sure that the object IDs for the different data stores on different devices are attached on the server. That is to say, I will have a table of object IDs and device IDs, which are tied via a reference to the object stored in the database. I will have a record (DatabaseId [unique to this table], ObjectId [unique to the item in the whole database], Datafield1, Datafield2), the ObjectId field will reference another table, AllObjects: (ObjectId, DeviceId, DeviceObjectId). Then, when the device pushes up a change set, it will pass along the device Id and the objectId from the core data object in the local data store. Then my cloud server will check against the objectId and device Id in the AllObjects table, and find the record to change in the initial table.</li>
<li>All changes should be timestamped, so that they can be merged.</li>
<li>The device will have to poll the server, without using up too much battery.</li>
<li>The local devices will also need to update anything held in memory if/when changes are received from the server.</li>
</ol>

<p>Is there anything else I am missing here? What kinds of frameworks should I look at to make this possible?</p>

"5037580","<p>So, the title should speak for itself.</p>

<p>To create re-usable components in ASP.NET MVC, we have 3 options (could be others i haven't mentioned):</p>

<p><em>Partial View:</em></p>

<pre><code>@Html.Partial(Model.Foo, ""SomePartial"")
</code></pre>

<p><em>Custom Editor Template:</em></p>

<pre><code>@Html.EditorFor(model =&gt; model.Foo)
</code></pre>

<p><em>Custom Display Template:</em></p>

<pre><code>@Html.DisplayFor(model =&gt; model.Foo)
</code></pre>

<p>In terms of the actual View/HTML, all three implementations are identical:</p>

<pre><code>@model WebApplications.Models.FooObject

&lt;!-- Bunch of HTML --&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>So, my question is - when/how do you decide which one of the three to use?</strong></p>

<p>What i'm really looking for is a list of questions to ask yourself before creating one, for which the answers can be used to decide on which template to use.</p>

<p>Here's the 2 things i have found better with EditorFor/DisplayFor:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>They respect model hierarchies when rendering HTML helpers (e.g if you have a ""Bar"" object on your ""Foo"" model, the HTML elements for ""Bar"" will be rendered with ""Foo.Bar.ElementName"", whilst a partial will have ""ElementName"").</p></li>
<li><p>More robust, e.g if you had a <code>List&lt;T&gt;</code> of something in your ViewModel, you could use <code>@Html.DisplayFor(model =&gt; model.CollectionOfFoo)</code>, and MVC is smart enough to see it's a collection and render out the single display for each item (as opposed to a Partial, which would require an explicit for loop).</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I've also heard DisplayFor renders a ""read-only"" template, but i don't understand that - couldn't i throw a form on there?</p>

<p>Can someone tell me some other reasons? Is there a list/article somewhere comparing the three?</p>

<p>As a result, there will be a 4&nbsp;pixel wide space between the SPAN elements.</p>

<p><strong>Demo:</strong> <a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/dGHFV/"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://jsfiddle.net/dGHFV/</a></p>

<p>I understand why this happens, and I also know that I could get rid of that space by removing the white-space between the SPAN elements in the HTML source code, like so:</p>

<pre class=""lang-html prettyprint-override""><code>&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;span&gt; Foo &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; Bar &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>However, I was hoping for a CSS solution that doesn't require the HTML source code to be tampered with.</p>

<p>I know how to solve this with JavaScript - by removing the text nodes from the container element (the paragraph), like so:</p>

<pre class=""lang-js prettyprint-override""><code>// jQuery
$('p').contents().filter(function() { return this.nodeType === 3; }).remove();
</code></pre>

<p>However, I'm not sure I'm understanding things correctly.</p>
<p>To help prevent session fixation, is it enough to call <code>session_regenerate_id(true);</code> after successfully logging someone in? I think I understand that correctly.</p>
<p>He also talks about using tokens passed along in urls via <code>$_GET</code> to prevent session hijacking. How would this be done exactly? I'm guessing when someone logs in you generate their token and store it in a session variable, then on each page you'd compare that session variable with the value of the <code>$_GET</code> variable?</p>
<p>Would this token need to be changed only once per session or on each page load?</p>
<p>Also is there a good way of preventing hijacking without having to pass a value along in the URLs? This would be a lot easier.</p>

<p>Python 3.6 has now introduced another string formatting format of string literals (aka &quot;f&quot; strings) via the syntax <code>f&quot;my string&quot;</code>. Is this formatting option better than the others?</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The following uses each method and has the same outcome, so what is the difference?</p>

<p>Goal: to make it possible to allow the client to instantiate some object using factory methods instead of the object's constructors, without unacceptable consequences and a performance hit. </p>

<p>By ""Factory method pattern"", I mean both static factory methods inside an object or methods defined in another class, or global functions. Just generally ""the concept of redirecting the normal way of instantiation of class X to anywhere else than the constructor"".</p>

<p>Let me skim through some possible answers which I have thought of.</p>

<hr>

<h2>0) Don't make factories, make constructors.</h2>

<p>This sounds nice (and indeed often the best solution), but is not a general remedy. First of all, there are cases when object construction is a task complex enough to justify its extraction to another class. But even putting that fact aside, even for simple objects using just constructors often won't do.</p>

<p>The simplest example I know is a 2-D Vector class. So simple, yet tricky. I want to be able to construct it both from both Cartesian and polar coordinates. Obviously, I cannot do:</p>

<pre><code>struct Vec2 {
    Vec2(float x, float y);
    Vec2(float angle, float magnitude); // not a valid overload!
    // ...
};
</code></pre>

<p>My natural way of thinking is then:</p>

<pre><code>struct Vec2 {
    static Vec2 fromLinear(float x, float y);
    static Vec2 fromPolar(float angle, float magnitude);
    // ...
};
</code></pre>

<p>Which, instead of constructors, leads me to usage of static factory methods... which essentially means that I'm implementing the factory pattern, in some way (""the class becomes its own factory""). This looks nice (and would suit this particular case), but fails in some cases, which I'm going to describe in point 2. Do read on.</p>

<p><em>another case: trying to overload by two opaque typedefs of some API (such as GUIDs of unrelated domains, or a GUID and a bitfield), types semantically totally different (so - in theory - valid overloads) but which actually turn out to be the same thing - like unsigned ints or void pointers.</em></p>

<hr>

<h2>1) The Java Way</h2>

<p>Java has it simple, as we only have dynamic-allocated objects. Making a factory is as trivial as:</p>

<pre><code>class FooFactory {
    public Foo createFooInSomeWay() {
        // can be a static method as well,
        //  if we don't need the factory to provide its own object semantics
        //  and just serve as a group of methods
        return new Foo(some, args);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>In C++, this translates to:</p>

<pre><code>class FooFactory {
public:
    Foo* createFooInSomeWay() {
        return new Foo(some, args);
    }
};
</code></pre>

<p>Cool? Often, indeed. But then- this forces the user to only use dynamic allocation. Static allocation is what makes C++ complex, but is also what often makes it powerful. Also, I believe that there exist some targets (keyword: embedded) which don't allow for dynamic allocation. And that doesn't imply that the users of those platforms like to write clean OOP.</p>

<p>Anyway, philosophy aside: In the general case, I don't want to force the users of the factory to be restrained to dynamic allocation.</p>

<hr>

<h2>2) Return-by-value</h2>

<p>OK, so we know that 1) is cool when we want dynamic allocation. Why won't we add static allocation on top of that?</p>

<pre><code>class FooFactory {
public:
    Foo* createFooInSomeWay() {
        return new Foo(some, args);
    }
    Foo createFooInSomeWay() {
        return Foo(some, args);
    }
};
</code></pre>

<p>What? We can't overload by the return type? Oh, of course we can't. So let's change the method names to reflect that. And yes, I've written the invalid code example above just to stress how much I dislike the need to change the method name, for example because we cannot implement a language-agnostic factory design properly now, since we have to change names - and every user of this code will need to remember that difference of the implementation from the specification.</p>

<pre><code>class FooFactory {
public:
    Foo* createDynamicFooInSomeWay() {
        return new Foo(some, args);
    }
    Foo createFooObjectInSomeWay() {
        return Foo(some, args);
    }
};
</code></pre>

<p>OK... there we have it. It's ugly, as we need to change the method name. It's imperfect, since we need to write the same code twice. But once done, it works. Right?</p>

<p>Well, usually. But sometimes it does not. When creating Foo, we actually depend on the compiler to do the return value optimisation for us, because the C++ standard is benevolent enough for the compiler vendors not to specify when will the object created in-place and when will it be copied when returning a temporary object by value in C++. So if Foo is expensive to copy, this approach is risky.</p>

<p>And what if Foo is not copiable at all? Well, doh. (<em>Note that in C++17 with guaranteed copy elision, not-being-copiable is no problem anymore for the code above</em>)</p>

<p>Conclusion: Making a factory by returning an object is indeed a solution for some cases (such as the 2-D vector previously mentioned), but still not a general replacement for constructors.</p>

<hr>

<h2>3) Two-phase construction</h2>

<p>Another thing that someone would probably come up with is separating the issue of object allocation and its initialisation. This usually results in code like this:</p>

<pre><code>class Foo {
public:
    Foo() {
        // empty or almost empty
    }
    // ...
};

class FooFactory {
public:
    void createFooInSomeWay(Foo&amp; foo, some, args);
};

void clientCode() {
    Foo staticFoo;
    auto_ptr&lt;Foo&gt; dynamicFoo = new Foo();
    FooFactory factory;
    factory.createFooInSomeWay(&amp;staticFoo);
    factory.createFooInSomeWay(&amp;dynamicFoo.get());
    // ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>One may think it works like a charm. The only price we pay for in our code...</p>

<p>Since I've written all of this and left this as the last, I must dislike it too. :) Why?</p>

<p>First of all... I sincerely dislike the concept of two-phase construction and I feel guilty when I use it. If I design my objects with the assertion that ""if it exists, it is in valid state"", I feel that my code is safer and less error-prone. I like it that way.</p>

<p>Having to drop that convention AND changing the design of my object just for the purpose of making factory of it is.. well,  unwieldy.</p>

<p>I know that the above won't convince many people, so let's me give some more solid arguments. Using two-phase construction, you cannot:</p>

<ul>
<li>initialise <code>const</code> or reference member variables,</li>
<li>pass arguments to base class constructors and member object constructors.</li>
</ul>

<p>And probably there could be some more drawbacks which I can't think of right now, and I don't even feel particularly obliged to since the above bullet points convince me already.</p>

<p>So: not even close to a good general solution for implementing a factory.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Conclusions:</h2>

<p>We want to have a way of object instantiation which would: </p>

<ul>
<li>allow for uniform instantiation regardless of allocation,</li>
<li>give different, meaningful names to construction methods (thus not relying on by-argument overloading),</li>
<li>not introduce a significant performance hit and, preferably, a significant code bloat hit, especially at client side,</li>
<li>be general, as in: possible to be introduced for any class.</li>
</ul>

<p>I believe I have proven that the ways I have mentioned don't fulfil those requirements.</p>

<p>Any hints? Please provide me with a solution, I don't want to think that this language won't allow me to properly implement such a trivial concept.</p>
