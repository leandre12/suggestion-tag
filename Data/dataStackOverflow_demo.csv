<p>What have you done, what tools have you used, and what success have you had with your approach?

"10752","<p>I know the so-called textbook definition of unit tests and integration tests.  What I am curious about is when it is time to write unit tests... I will write them to cover as many sets of classes as possible.</p>

<p>For example, if I have a <code>Word</code> class, I will write some unit tests for the <code>Word</code> class.  Then, I begin writing my <code>Sentence</code> class, and when it needs to interact with the <code>Word</code> class, I will often write my unit tests such that they test both <code>Sentence</code> and <code>Word</code>... at least in the places where they interact.</p>

<p><em>Have these tests essentially become integration tests because they now test the integration of these 2 classes, or is it just a unit test that spans 2 classes?</em></p>

<p>In general, because of this uncertain line, I will rarely actually write integration tests... or is my using the finished product to see if all the pieces work properly the actual integration tests, even though they are manual and rarely repeated beyond the scope of each individual feature?</p>

<p>We're about to ramp up a new project where nearly all of our database op's will be fairly simple data retrievals (there's another segment of the project which already writes the data). Most of our other projects up to this point make use of stored procedures for such things. However, I'd like to leverage LINQ-to-SQL if it makes more sense.</p>

"16322","<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>One of the things I've asked a lot about on this site is <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/netframework/aa904594.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">LINQ</a>. The questions I've asked have been wide and varied and often don't have much context behind them. So in an attempt to consolidate the knowledge I've acquired on Linq I'm posting this question with a view to maintaining and updating it with additional information as I continue to learn about LINQ.</p>
<p>I also hope that it will prove to be a useful resource for other people wanting to learn about LINQ.</p>
<h2>What is LINQ?</h2>
<p>From <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/netframework/aa904594.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">MSDN</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The LINQ Project is a codename for a
set of extensions to the .NET
Framework that encompass
language-integrated query, set, and
transform operations. It extends C#
and Visual Basic with native language
syntax for queries and provides class
libraries to take advantage of these
capabilities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What this means is that LINQ provides a standard way to query a variety of datasources using a common syntax.</p>
<h2>What flavours of LINQ are there?</h2>
<p>Currently there are a few different LINQ providers provided by Microsoft:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb397919.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">Linq to Objects</a> which allows you to execute queries on any IEnumerable object.</li>
<li><a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb425822.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">Linq to SQL</a> which allows you to execute queries against a database in an object oriented manner.</li>
<li><a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb387098.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">Linq to XML</a> which allows you to query, load, validate, serialize and manipulate XML documents.</li>
<li><a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb386964.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">Linq to Entities</a> as suggested by <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16322/all-about-linq#33588"">Andrei</a></li>
<li><a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb399399.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">Linq to Dataset</a></li>
</ul>
<p>There are quite a few others, many of which are listed <a href=""http://blogs.microsoft.co.il/blogs/vardi/archive/2008/10/09/the-linq-list-projects.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a>.</p>
<h2>What are the benefits?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Standardized way to query multiple datasources</li>
<li>Compile time safety of queries</li>
<li>Optimized way to perform set based operations on in memory objects</li>
<li>Ability to debug queries</li>
</ul>

<h2>What do I need to use LINQ?</h2>
<p>Linq is currently available in VB.Net 9.0 and C# 3.0 so you'll need Visual Studio 2008 or greater to get the full benefits. (You could always write your code in notepad and compile using MSBuild)</p>
<p>There is also a tool called <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7652/querying-like-linq-when-you-dont-have-linq#7710"">LinqBridge</a> which will allow you to run Linq like queries in C# 2.0.</p>

"23287","<p>What is the best approach to calculating the largest prime factor of a number?</p>

<p>I'm thinking the most efficient would be the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Find lowest prime number that divides cleanly</li>
<li>Check if result of division is prime</li>
<li>If not, find next lowest</li>
<li>Go to 2.</li>
</ol>

<p>I'm basing this assumption on it being easier to calculate the small prime factors. Is this about right? What other approaches should I look into?</p>

<p>Edit: I've now realised that my approach is futile if there are more than 2 prime factors in play, since step 2 fails when the result is a product of two other primes, therefore a recursive algorithm is needed.</p>

<p>Edit again: And now I've realised that this does still work, because the last found prime number has to be the highest one, therefore any further testing of the non-prime result from step 2 would result in a smaller prime.</p>

"24109","<p>I want to expand my programming horizons to Linux. A good, dependable basic toolset is important, and what is more basic than an IDE?</p>

<p>I could find these SO topics:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2756/lightweight-ide-for-linux"">Lightweight IDE for linux</a> and</li>
<li><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17228/what-tools-do-you-use-to-develop-c-applications-on-linux"">What tools do you use to develop
C++ applications on Linux?</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I'm not looking for a <em>lightweight</em> IDE. If an IDE is worth the money, then I will pay for it, so it need not be free.</p>

<p>My question, then:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>What good, C++ programming IDE is available for Linux?</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The minimums are fairly standard: syntax highlighting, code completion (like <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IntelliSense"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">intellisense</a> or its Eclipse counterpart) and integrated debugging (e.g., basic
breakpoints).</p>

<p>I have searched for it myself, but there are so many that it is almost impossible to separate the good from the bads by hand, especially for someone like me who has little  C++ coding experience in Linux. I know that <a href=""http://www.eclipse.org/cdt/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Eclipse supports C++</a>, and I really like that IDE for Java, but is it any good for C++ and is there something better?</p>

<p>The second post actually has some good suggestions, but what I am missing is what exactly makes the sugested IDE so good for the user, what are its (dis)advantages?</p>

<p>Maybe my question should therefore be:</p>

"24675","<p>Before you answer this I have never developed anything popular enough to attain high server loads. Treat me as (sigh) an alien that has just landed on the planet, albeit one that knows PHP and a few optimisation techniques.</p>

<hr>

<p>I'm developing a tool in <strong>PHP</strong> that could attain quite a lot of users, if it works out right. However while I'm fully capable of developing the program I'm pretty much clueless when it comes to making something that can deal with huge traffic. So here's a few questions on it (feel free to turn this question into a resource thread as well).</p>

<h2>Databases</h2>

<p>At the moment I plan to use the MySQLi features in PHP5. However how should I setup the databases in relation to users and content? Do I actually <em>need</em> multiple databases? At the moment everything's jumbled into one database - although I've been considering spreading user data to one, actual content to another and finally core site content (template masters etc.) to another. My reasoning behind this is that sending queries to different databases will ease up the load on them as one database = 3 load sources. Also would this still be effective if they were all on the same server?</p>

<h2>Caching</h2>

<p>I have a template system that is used to build the pages and swap out variables. Master templates are stored in the database and each time a template is called it's cached copy (a html document) is called. At the moment I have two types of variable in these templates - a static var and a dynamic var. Static vars are usually things like page names, the name of the site - things that don't change often; dynamic vars are things that change on each page load.</p>

<p>My question on this:</p>

<p>Say I have comments on different articles. Which is a better solution: store the simple comment template and render comments (from a DB call) each time the page is loaded or store a cached copy of the comments page as a html page - each time a comment is added/edited/deleted the page is recached.</p>

<h2>Finally</h2>

<p>Does anyone have any tips/pointers for running a high load site on PHP. I'm pretty sure it's a workable language to use - Facebook and Yahoo! give it great precedence - but are there any experiences I should watch out for?</p>

<p>Also, as a brief aside, is jQuery worth learning? Or should I look at different JavaScript libraries? I know Jeff uses jQuery on Stack Overflow and it seems to be working well.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: jQuery's website has a <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">pretty big list of tutorials</a>, and a seemingly comprehensive <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Main_Page"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">documentation page</a>. I haven't had time to go through it all yet, has anyone else had experience with it?</p>

<p><strong>Edit 2</strong>: It seems Google is now hosting the jQuery libraries. That should give jQuery a pretty big advantage in terms of publicity. </p>

<p>Also, if everyone uses a single unified aQuery library hosted at the same place, it should get cached for most Internet users early on and therefore not impact the download footprint of your site should you decide to use it.</p>

<h2>2 Months Later...</h2>

<p><strong>Edit 3</strong>: I started using jQuery on a project at work recently and it is great to work with! Just wanted to let everyone know that I have concluded it is <strong><em>ABSOLUTELY</em></strong> worth it to learn and use jQuery.</p>

<p>Also, I learned almost entirely from the Official jQuery <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Main_Page"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">documentation</a> and <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">tutorials</a>. It's very straightforward.</p>

<h2>10 Months Later...</h2>

<p>jQuery is a part of just about every web app I've made since I initially wrote this post. It makes progressive enhancement a breeze, and helps make the code maintainable.</p>

<p>Also, all the jQuery plug-ins are an invaluable resource!</p>

<h2>3 Years Later...</h2>

<p>Still using jQuery just about every day. I now author jQuery plug-ins and consult full time. I'm primarily a Djangonaut but I've done several javascript only contracts with jQuery. It's a life saver.</p>

<p>From one jQuery user to another... You should look at <a href=""http://api.jquery.com/category/plugins/templates/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">templating with jQuery</a> (or underscore -- see below).</p>

"32414","<p>We are currently working in a private beta and so are still in the process of making fairly rapid changes, although obviously as usage is starting to ramp up, we will be slowing down this process.  That being said, one issue we are running into is that after we push out an update with new JavaScript files, the client browsers still use the cached version of the file and they do not see the update.  Obviously, on a support call, we can simply inform them to do a <kbd>ctrl</kbd><kbd>F5</kbd> refresh to ensure that they get the up-to-date files from the server, but it would be preferable to handle this before that time.</p>

<p>Our current thought is to simply attach a version number onto the name of the JavaScript files and then when changes are made, increment the version on the script and update all references.  This definitely gets the job done, but updating the references on each release could get cumbersome.</p>

<p>As I'm sure we're not the first ones to deal with this, I figured I would throw it out to the community.  How are you ensuring clients update their cache when you update your code?  If you're using the method described above, are you using a process that simplifies the change?</p>

"41479","<p>After discussion with colleagues regarding the use of the 'var' keyword in C# 3 I wondered what people's opinions were on the appropriate uses of type inference via var?</p>

<p>For example I rather lazily used var in questionable circumstances, e.g.:-</p>

<pre><code>foreach(var item in someList) { // ... } // Type of 'item' not clear.
var something = someObject.SomeProperty; // Type of 'something' not clear.
var something = someMethod(); // Type of 'something' not clear.
</code></pre>

<p>More legitimate uses of var are as follows:-</p>

<pre><code>var l = new List&lt;string&gt;(); // Obvious what l will be.
var s = new SomeClass(); // Obvious what s will be.
</code></pre>

<p>Interestingly LINQ seems to be a bit of a grey area, e.g.:-</p>

<pre><code>var results = from r in dataContext.SomeTable
              select r; // Not *entirely clear* what results will be here.
</code></pre>

<p>It's clear what results will be in that it will be a type which implements IEnumerable, however it isn't entirely obvious in the same way a var declaring a new object is.</p>

<p>It's even worse when it comes to LINQ to objects, e.g.:-</p>

<pre><code>var results = from item in someList
              where item != 3
              select item;
</code></pre>

<p>This is no better than the equivilent foreach(var item in someList) { // ... } equivilent.</p>

<p>There is a real concern about type safety here - for example if we were to place the results of that query into an overloaded method that accepted IEnumerable&lt;int&gt; and IEnumerable&lt;double&gt; the caller might inadvertently pass in the wrong type.</p>

<p><code>var</code> <em>does</em> maintain strong typing but the question is really whether it's dangerous for the type to not be immediately apparent on definition, something which is magnified when overloads mean compiler errors might not be issued when you unintentionally pass the wrong type to a method.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Finally a short story for the record.
  In 1968, the Communications of the ACM
  published a text of mine under the
  title ""<em>The goto statement considered
  harmful</em>"", which in later years would
  be most frequently referenced,
  regrettably, however, often by authors
  who had seen no more of it than its
  title, which became a cornerstone of
  my fame by becoming a template: we
  would see all sorts of articles under
  the title ""X considered harmful"" for
  almost any X, including one titled
  ""Dijkstra considered harmful"". But
  what had happened? I had submitted a
  paper under the title ""<strong><em>A case against
  the goto statement</em></strong>"", which, in order
  to speed up its publication, the
  editor had changed into a ""letter to
  the Editor"", and in the process he had
  given it a new title of his own
  invention! The editor was Niklaus
  Wirth.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A well thought out classic paper about this topic, to be matched to that of Dijkstra, is <a href=""http://www.clifford.at/cfun/cliffdev/p261-knuth.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">Structured Programming with go to Statements</a>, by Donald E. Knuth. Reading both helps to reestablish context and a non-dogmatic understanding of the subject. In this paper, Dijkstra's opinion on this case is reported and is even more strong:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Donald E. Knuth:</em> I believe that by presenting such a
  view I am not in fact disagreeing
  sharply with Dijkstra's ideas, since
  he recently wrote the following:
  ""Please don't fall into the trap of
  believing that I am terribly
  dogmatical about [the go to
  statement]. <strong>I have the uncomfortable
  feeling that others are making a
  religion out of it, as if the
  conceptual problems of programming
  could be solved by a single trick, by
  a simple form of coding discipline!</strong>""</p>

<p>To clarify, I would like to get the current CPU usage for the whole system, not just the Java process(es).</p>

<p>The SIGAR API provides all the functionality I'm looking for in one package, so it's the best answer to my question so far. However, due it being licensed under the GPL, I cannot use it for my original purpose (a closed source, commercial product). It's possible that Hyperic may license SIGAR for commercial use, but I haven't looked into it. For my GPL projects, I will definitely consider SIGAR in the future.</p>

<p>For my current needs, I'm leaning towards the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>For CPU usage, <code>OperatingSystemMXBean.getSystemLoadAverage() / OperatingSystemMXBean.getAvailableProcessors()</code> (load average per cpu)</li>
<li>For memory, <code>OperatingSystemMXBean.getTotalPhysicalMemorySize()</code> and <code>OperatingSystemMXBean.getFreePhysicalMemorySize()</code></li>
<li>For disk space, <code>File.getTotalSpace()</code> and <code>File.getUsableSpace()</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Limitations:</p>

<p>The <code>getSystemLoadAverage()</code> and disk space querying methods are only available under Java 6. Also, some JMX functionality may not be available to all platforms (i.e. it's been reported that <code>getSystemLoadAverage()</code> returns -1 on Windows).</p>

<p>EDIT: The following code was helpful with chaining. However, (in Internet&nbsp;Explorer) <code>.val('whatever')</code> did not select the option that was added. (I did use the same 'value' in both <code>.append</code> and <code>.val</code>.)</p>

<pre><code>$('#mySelect').find('option').remove().end()

<p>EDIT: Trying to get it to mimic this code, I use the following code whenever the page/form is reset. This select box is populated by a set of radio buttons. <code>.focus()</code> was closer, but the option did not appear selected like it does with <code>.selected= ""true""</code>.

"61401","<p>I know this sounds like a point-whoring question but let me explain where I'm coming from.</p>

<p>Out of college I got a job at a PHP shop.  I worked there for a year and a half and thought that I had learned all there was to learn about programming.</p>

<p>Then I got a job as a one-man internal development shop at a sizable corporation where all the work was in C#.  In my commitment to the position I started reading a ton of blogs and books and quickly realized how wrong I was to think I knew everything.  I learned about unit testing, dependency injection and decorator patterns, the design principle of loose coupling, the composition over inheritance debate, and so on and on and on - I am still very much absorbing it all.  Needless to say my programming style has changed entirely in the last year.</p>

<p>Now I find myself picking up a php project doing some coding for a friend's start-up and I feel completely constrained as opposed to programming in C#.  It really bothers me that all variables at a class scope have to be referred to by appending '$this->' .  It annoys me that none of the IDEs that I've tried have very good intellisense and that my SimpleTest unit tests methods have to start with the word 'test'.  It drives me crazy that dynamic typing keeps me from specifying implicitly which parameter type a method expects, and that you have to write a switch statement to do method overloads.  I can't stand that you can't have nested namespaces and have to use the :: operator to call the base class's constructor.</p>

<p>Now I have no intention of starting a PHP vs C# debate, rather what I mean to say is that I'm sure there are some PHP features that I either don't know about or know about yet fail to use properly.  I am set in my C# universe and having trouble seeing outside the glass bowl.</p>

<p>So I'm asking, what are your favorite features of PHP?  What are things you can do in it that you can't or are more difficult in the .Net languages?</p>

"63421","<p>Currently my workflow with Emacs when I am coding in C or C++ involves three windows.  The largest on the right contains the file I am working with.  The left is split into two, the bottom being a shell which I use to type in compile or make commands, and the top is often some sort of documentation or README file that I want to consult while I am working.  Now I know there are some pretty expert Emacs users out there, and I am curious what other Emacs functionally is useful if the intention is to use it as a complete IDE.  Specifically, most IDEs usually fulfill these functions is some form or another:</p>

<ul>
<li>Source code editor</li>
<li>Compiler</li>
<li>Debugging</li>
<li>Documentation Lookup</li>
<li>Version Control</li>
<li>OO features like class lookup and object inspector </li>
</ul>

<p>For a few of these, it's pretty obvious how Emacs can fit these functions, but what about the rest?  Also, if a specific language must be focused on, I'd say it should be C++. </p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> One user pointed out that I should have been more specific when I said 'what about the rest'.  Mostly I was curious about efficient version control, as well as documentation lookup.  For example, in SLIME it is fairly easy to do a quick hyperspec lookup on a Lisp function.

"70528","<p>Python gives us the ability to create 'private' methods and variables within a class by prepending double underscores to the name, like this: <code>__myPrivateMethod()</code>. How, then, can one explain this</p>

<pre><code>>>> class MyClass:
...     def myPublicMethod(self):
...             print 'public method'
...     def __myPrivateMethod(self):
...             print 'this is private!!'
... 
>>> obj = MyClass()
>>> obj.myPublicMethod()

AttributeError: MyClass instance has no attribute '__myPrivateMethod'
>>> dir(obj)
['_MyClass__myPrivateMethod', '__doc__', '__module__', 'myPublicMethod']
>>> obj._MyClass__myPrivateMethod()
this is private!!
</code></pre>

<p>What's the deal?!</p>

<p>I'll explain this a little for those who didn't quite get that.</p>

<pre><code>>>> class MyClass:
...     def myPublicMethod(self):
...             print 'public method'
...     def __myPrivateMethod(self):
...             print 'this is private!!'
... 
>>> obj = MyClass()
</code></pre>

<p>What I did there is create a class with a public method and a private method and instantiate it.</p>

<p>Next, I call its public method.</p>

<pre><code>>>> obj.myPublicMethod()
public method
</code></pre>

<p>Next, I try and call its private method.</p>

<pre><code>>>> obj.__myPrivateMethod()
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File """", line 1, in 
AttributeError: MyClass instance has no attribute '__myPrivateMethod'
</code></pre>

<p>Everything looks good here; we're unable to call it. It is, in fact, 'private'. Well, actually it isn't. Running <em>dir()</em> on the object reveals a new magical method that python creates magically for all of your 'private' methods.</p>

<pre><code>>>> dir(obj)
['_MyClass__myPrivateMethod', '__doc__', '__module__', 'myPublicMethod']
</code></pre>

<p>This new method's name is always an underscore, followed by the class name, followed by the method name.</p>

<pre><code>>>> obj._MyClass__myPrivateMethod()
this is private!!
</code></pre>

<p>Say I'm creating a word frequency list, using a Map (probably a HashMap), where each key is a String with the word that's being counted and the value is an Integer that's incremented each time a token of the word is found.</p>

<p>In Perl, incrementing such a value would be trivially easy:</p>

<pre><code>$map{$word}++;
</code></pre>

<p>But in Java, it's much more complicated. Here the way I'm currently doing it:</p>

<pre><code>int count = map.containsKey(word) ? map.get(word) : 0;
map.put(word, count + 1);
</code></pre>

<p>Which of course relies on the autoboxing feature in the newer Java versions. I wonder if you can suggest a more efficient way of incrementing such a value. Are there even good performance reasons for eschewing the Collections framework and using a something else instead?</p>

<p>I've always been searching for a way to make Visual Studio draw a line after a certain amount of characters.</p>

<p>Below is a guide to enable these so called <em>guidelines</em> for various versions of Visual Studio.</p>

<p><strong>Visual Studio 2013</strong></p>

<p>Install Paul Harrington's Editor Guidelines extension for <a href=""http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/da227a0b-0e31-4a11-8f6b-3a149cf2e459/view/Reviews"" rel=""noreferrer"">VS 2013</a></p>

<p><strong>Visual Studio 2010 and 2012</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Install Paul Harrington's Editor Guidelines extension for <a href=""http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/0fbf2878-e678-4577-9fdb-9030389b338c"" rel=""noreferrer"">VS 2010</a> or <a href=""http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/da227a0b-0e31-4a11-8f6b-3a149cf2e459?SRC=Home"" rel=""noreferrer"">VS 2012</a>.</li>
<li>Open the registry at:
<br />VS 2010: <code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\VisualStudio\10.0\Text Editor</code>
<br />VS 2012: <code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\VisualStudio\11.0\Text Editor</code>
<br />and add a new string called <code>Guides</code> with the value <code>RGB(100,100,100), 80</code>. The 
first part specifies the color, while the other one (<code>80</code>) is the column the line will be displayed.</li>
<li>Or install the <a href=""http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/7f2a6727-2993-4c1d-8f58-ae24df14ea91"" rel=""noreferrer"">Guidelines UI</a> extension (which is also a part of the <a href=""http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/d0d33361-18e2-46c0-8ff2-4adea1e34fef/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Productivity Power Tools</a>), which will add entries to the editor's context menu for adding/removing the entries without needing to edit the registry directly. The current disadvantage of this method is that you can't specify the column directly.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Visual Studio 2008 and Other Versions</strong></p>

<p>If you are using Visual Studio 2008 open the registry at <code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\VisualStudio\9.0\Text Editor</code> and add a new string called <code>Guides</code> with the value <code>RGB(100,100,100), 80</code>. The first part specifies the color, while the other one (<code>80</code>) is the column the line will be displayed. The vertical line will appear, when you restart Visual Studio.</p>

<p>This trick also works for various other version of Visual Studio, as long as you use the correct path:</p>

<pre><code>2003: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\VisualStudio\7.1\Text Editor
2005: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\VisualStudio\8.0\Text Editor
2008: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\VisualStudio\9.0\Text Editor
2008 Express: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\VCExpress\9.0\Text Editor
</code></pre>

   From another question I provided an answer that has links to a lot of questions/answers about singletons: <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1008019/c-singleton-design-pattern/1008289#1008289"">More info about singletons here:</a></p>

<p>So I have read the thread <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11831/singletons-good-design-or-a-crutch"">Singletons: good design or a crutch?</a><br>
And the argument still rages.</p>

<p>I see Singletons as a Design Pattern (good and bad).<br><br>
The problem with Singleton is not the Pattern but rather the users (sorry everybody). Everybody and their father thinks they can implement one correctly (and from the many interviews I have done, most people can't). Also because everybody thinks they can implement a correct Singleton they abuse the Pattern and use it in situations that are not appropriate (replacing global variables with Singletons!).</p>

<p>So the main questions that need to be answered are:</p>

<ul>
<li>When should you use a Singleton</li>
<li>How do you implement a Singleton correctly</li>
</ul>

<p>My hope for this article is that we can collect together in a single place (rather than having to google and search multiple sites) an authoritative source of when (and then how) to use a Singleton correctly. Also appropriate would be a list of Anti-Usages and common bad implementations explaining why they fail to work and for good implementations their weaknesses.<br><br><hr></p>

<p>So get the ball rolling:<br>
I will hold my hand up and say this is what I use but probably has problems.<br>
I like ""Scott Myers"" handling of the subject in his books ""Effective C++""</p>

"90178","<p>I am working on a web application where I want the content to fill the height of the entire screen.</p>

<p>The page has a header, which contains a logo, and account information. This could be an arbitrary height. I want the content div to fill the rest of the page to the bottom.</p>

<p>I have a header <code>div</code> and a content <code>div</code>. At the moment I am using a table for the layout like so:</p>

<p>CSS and HTML</p>

<p><div class=""snippet"" data-lang=""js"" data-hide=""false"" data-console=""false"" data-babel=""false"">
<div class=""snippet-code"">
<pre class=""snippet-code-css lang-css prettyprint-override""><code>#page {
    height: 100%; width: 100%
}

#tdcontent {
    height: 100%;
}

#content {
    overflow: auto; /* or overflow: hidden; */
}</code></pre>
<pre class=""snippet-code-html lang-html prettyprint-override""><code>&lt;table id=""page""&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td id=""tdheader""&gt;
            &lt;div id=""header""&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td id=""tdcontent""&gt;
            &lt;div id=""content""&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</p>

<p>The entire height of the page is filled, and no scrolling is required.</p>

<p>For anything inside the content div, setting <code>top: 0;</code> will put it right underneath the header. Sometimes the content will be a real table, with its height set to 100%. Putting <code>header</code> inside <code>content</code> will not allow this to work.</p>

<p>Is there a way to achieve the same effect without using the <code>table</code>?</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>Elements inside the content <code>div</code> will have heights set to percentages as well. So something at 100% inside the <code>div</code> will fill it to the bottom. As will two elements at 50%.</p>

<p><strong>Update 2:</strong></p>

<p>For instance, if the header takes up 20% of the screen's height, a table specified at 50% inside <code>#content</code> would take up 40% of the screen space. So far, wrapping the entire thing in a table is the only thing that works.</p>

static int foo = 1;            static int foo = 10;

"94227","<p>C++ is all about memory ownership - aka <strong>ownership semantics</strong>.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the owner of a chunk of dynamically allocated memory to release that memory. So the question really becomes who owns the memory.</p>
<p>In C++ ownership is documented by the type a <em>raw</em> pointer is wrapped inside thus in a good (IMO) C++ program it is very rare (<em>rare</em>, not <em>never</em>) to see raw pointers passed around (as raw pointers have no inferred ownership thus we can not tell who owns the memory and thus without careful reading of the documentation you can't tell who is responsible for ownership).</p>
<p>Conversely, it is rare to see raw pointers stored in a class each raw pointer is stored within its own smart pointer wrapper. (<strong>N.B.:</strong> If you don't own an object you should not be storing it because you can not know when it will go out of scope and be destroyed.)</p>
<p>So the question:</p>
<ul>
<li>What type of ownership semantic have people come across?</li>
<li>What standard classes are used to implement those semantics?</li>
<li>In what situations do you find them useful?</li>
</ul>
<p>Lets keep 1 type of semantic ownership per answer so they can be voted up and down individually.</p>
<h2>Summary:</h2>
<p>Conceptually, smart pointers are simple and a naive implementation is easy. I have seen many attempted implementations, but invariably they are broken in some way that is not obvious to casual use and examples. Thus I recommend always using well tested smart pointers from a library rather than rolling your own. <code>std::auto_ptr</code> or one of the Boost smart pointers seem to cover all my needs.</p>
<h3><code>std::auto_ptr&lt;T&gt;</code>:</h3>
<p>Single person owns the object. Transfer of ownership is allowed.</p>
<p>Usage: This allows you to define interfaces that show the explicit transfer of ownership.</p>
<h3><code>boost::scoped_ptr&lt;T&gt;</code></h3>
<p>Single person owns the object. Transfer of ownership is NOT allowed.</p>
<p>Usage: Used to show explicit ownership. Object will be destroyed by destructor or when explicitly reset.</p>
<h3><code>boost::shared_ptr&lt;T&gt;</code> (<code>std::tr1::shared_ptr&lt;T&gt;</code>)</h3>
<p>Multiple ownership. This is a simple reference counted pointer. When the reference count reaches zero, the object is destroyed.</p>
<p>Usage: When an object can have multiple owers with a lifetime that can not be determined at compile time.</p>
<h3><code>boost::weak_ptr&lt;T&gt;</code>:</h3>
<p>Used with <code>shared_ptr&lt;T&gt;</code> in situations where a cycle of pointers may happen.</p>
<p>Usage: Used to stop cycles from retaining objects when only the cycle is maintaining a shared refcount.</p>

"142003","<p>I have a scenario. (Windows Forms, C#, .NET)</p>

<ol>
<li>There is a main form which hosts some user control.</li>
<li>The user control does some heavy data operation, such that if I directly call the <code>UserControl_Load</code> method the UI become nonresponsive for the duration for load method execution.</li>
<li>To overcome this I load data on different thread (trying to change existing code as little as I can)  </li>
<li>I used a background worker thread which will be loading the data and when done will notify the application that it has done its work.  </li>
<li>Now came a real problem. All the UI (main form and its child usercontrols) was created on the primary main thread. In the LOAD method of the usercontrol I'm fetching data based on the values of some control (like textbox) on userControl. </li>
</ol>

<p>The pseudocode would look like this:</p>

<p><strong>CODE 1</strong></p>

<pre><code>UserContrl1_LoadDataMethod()
{
    if (textbox1.text == ""MyName"") // This gives exception
    {
        //Load data corresponding to ""MyName"".
        //Populate a globale variable List&lt;string&gt; which will be binded to grid at some later stage.
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The Exception it gave was</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Cross-thread operation not valid: Control accessed from a thread other than the thread it was created on.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To know more about this I did some googling and a suggestion came up like using the following code</p>

<p><strong>CODE 2</strong></p>

<pre><code>UserContrl1_LoadDataMethod()
{
    if (InvokeRequired) // Line #1
    {
        this.Invoke(new MethodInvoker(UserContrl1_LoadDataMethod));
        return;
    }

    if (textbox1.text == ""MyName"") // Now it wont give an exception
    {
    //Load data correspondin to ""MyName""
        //Populate a globale variable List&lt;string&gt; which will be binded to grid at some later stage
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>BUT BUT BUT... it seems I'm back to square one. The Application again 
become nonresponsive. It seems to be due to the execution of line #1 if condition. The loading task is again done by the parent thread and not the third that I spawned.</p>

<p>I don't know whether I perceived this right or wrong. I'm new to threading.</p>

<p>How do I resolve this and also what is the effect of execution of Line#1 if block?</p>

"145110","<p>My understanding is that C/C++ produces native code to run on a particular machine architecture.  Conversely, languages like Java and C# run on top of a virtual machine which abstracts away the native architecture.  Logically it would seem impossible for Java or C# to match the speed of C++ because of this intermediate step, however I've been told that the latest compilers (""hot spot"") can attain this speed or even exceed it.</p>

<p>Perhaps this is more of a compiler question than a language question, but can anyone explain in plain English how it is possible for one of these virtual machine languages to perform better than a native language?</p>

"145131","<p>I work with a lot of web applications that are driven by databases of varying complexity on the backend. Typically, there's an <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping"" rel=""noreferrer"">ORM</a> layer separate from the business and presentation logic. This makes unit-testing the business logic fairly straightforward; things can be implemented in discrete modules and any data needed for the test can be faked through object mocking.</p>

<p>But testing the ORM and database itself has always been fraught with problems and compromises. </p>

<p>Over the years, I have tried a few strategies, none of which completely satisfied me.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Load a test database with known data. Run tests against the ORM and confirm that the right data comes back. The disadvantage here is that your test DB has to keep up with any schema changes in the application database, and might get out of sync. It also relies on artificial data, and may not expose bugs that occur due to stupid user input. Finally, if the test database is small, it won't reveal inefficiencies like a missing index. (OK, that last one isn't really what unit testing should be used for, but it doesn't hurt.)</p></li>
<li><p>Load a copy of the production database and test against that. The problem here is that you may have no idea what's in the production DB at any given time; your tests may need to be rewritten if data changes over time. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Some people have pointed out that both of these strategies rely on specific data, and a unit test should test only functionality. To that end, I've seen suggested:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use a mock database server, and check only that the ORM is sending the correct queries in response to a given method call.</li>
</ul>

I was hoping this was Kosher, but am I instead attempting to draw over other memory that I shouldn't be touching?</p>

<p>I was taking care to stack allocate things where I could, instead of heap allocating them. He was talking to me and watching over my shoulder and commented that it wasn't necessary because they are the same performance wise.</p>

<p>I was always under the impression that growing the stack was constant time, and heap allocation's performance depended on the current complexity of the heap for both allocation (finding a hole of the proper size) and de-allocating (collapsing holes to reduce fragmentation, as many standard library implementations take time to do this during deletes if I am not mistaken).</p>

<p>It is possible to use <a href=""http://www.otierney.net/objective-c.html#categories"" rel=""noreferrer"">categories</a> [e.g. MyClass (Private)] defined in MyClass.m file to group private methods.</p>

<p>This approach has 2 issues:</p>

<ol>
<li>Xcode (and compiler?) does not check if you define all methods in private category in corresponding @implementation block</li>
<li>You have to put @interface declaring your private category in the begin of MyClass.m file, otherwise Xcode complains with a message like ""self may not respond to message ""privateFoo"".</li>
</ol>

<p>The first issue can be worked around with <a href=""http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ObjectiveC/Articles/chapter_4_section_5.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30001163-CH20-SW2"" rel=""noreferrer"">empty category</a> [e.g. MyClass ()].<br/>

"187761","<p>POSIX allows mutexes to be recursive. That means the same thread can lock the same mutex twice and won't deadlock. Of course it also needs to unlock it twice, otherwise no other thread can obtain the mutex. Not all systems supporting pthreads also support recursive mutexes, but if they want to be <a href=""http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/pthread_mutexattr_gettype.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">POSIX conform, they have to</a>.</p>

<p>Other APIs (more high level APIs) also usually offer mutexes, often called Locks. Some systems/languages (e.g. Cocoa Objective-C) offer both, recursive and non recursive mutexes. Some languages also only offer one or the other one. E.g. in Java mutexes are always recursive (the same thread may twice ""synchronize"" on the same object). Depending on what other thread functionality they offer, not having recursive mutexes might be no problem, as they can easily be written yourself (I already implemented recursive mutexes myself on the basis of more simple mutex/condition operations).</p>

<p>What I don't really understand: What are non-recursive mutexes good for? Why would I want to have a thread deadlock if it locks the same mutex twice? Even high level languages that could avoid that (e.g. testing if this will deadlock and throwing an exception if it does) usually don't do that. They will let the thread deadlock instead.</p>

<p>Is this only for cases, where I accidentally lock it twice and only unlock it once and in case of a recursive mutex, it would be harder to find the problem, so instead I have it deadlock immediately to see where the incorrect lock appears? But couldn't I do the same with having a lock counter returned when unlocking and in a situation, where I'm sure I released the last lock and the counter is not zero, I can throw an exception or log the problem? Or is there any other, more useful use-case of non recursive mutexes that I fail to see? Or is it maybe just performance, as a non-recursive mutex can be slightly faster than a recursive one? However, I tested this and the difference is really not that big.</p>

<p>What minimalistic approach would you use to output that to HTML (or text, for that matter) as a correctly ordered, correctly indented tree? </p>

<p>Assume further you only have basic data structures (arrays and hashmaps), no fancy objects with parent/children references, no ORM, no framework, just your two hands. The table is represented as a result set, which can be accessed randomly. </p>

<p><strong>EDITS AND ADDITIONS</strong></p>

<p>To answer one commenter's (<a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/users/17826/mark-bessey"">Mark Bessey</a>'s) question: A root node is not necessary, because it is never going to be displayed anyway. ParentId = 0 is the convention to express ""these are top level"". The Order column defines how nodes with the same parent are going to be sorted.</p>

<p>The ""result set"" I spoke of can be pictured as an array of hashmaps (to stay in that terminology). For my example was meant to be already there. Some answers go the extra mile and construct it first, but thats okay.</p>

<p>The tree can be arbitrarily deep. Each node can have N children. I did not exactly have a ""millions of entries"" tree in mind, though.</p>

<p>Don't mistake my choice of node naming ('Node 1.1.1') for something to rely on. The nodes could equally well be called 'Frank' or 'Bob', no naming structure is implied, this was merely to make it readable.</p>

"218760","<p>Although elements like <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>s normally grow to fit their contents, using the <code>float</code> property can cause a startling problem for CSS newbies: <strong>If floated elements have non-floated parent elements, the parent will collapse.</strong></p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p><div class=""snippet"" data-lang=""js"" data-hide=""false"" data-console=""true"" data-babel=""false"">
<div class=""snippet-code"">
<pre class=""snippet-code-html lang-html prettyprint-override""><code>&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;div style=""float: left;""&gt;Div 1&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div style=""float: left;""&gt;Div 2&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</p>
<p>The parent div in this example will <strong>not expand</strong> to contain its floated children - it will appear to have <code>height: 0</code>.</p>
<h1>How do you solve this problem?</h1>
<p><em>I would like to create an exhaustive list of solutions here. If you're aware of cross-browser compatibility issues, please point them out.</em></p>
<h2>Solution 1</h2>
<p>Float the parent.</p>
<p><div class=""snippet"" data-lang=""js"" data-hide=""false"" data-console=""true"" data-babel=""false"">
<div class=""snippet-code"">
<pre class=""snippet-code-html lang-html prettyprint-override""><code>&lt;div style=""float: left;""&gt;
  &lt;div style=""float: left;""&gt;Div 1&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div style=""float: left;""&gt;Div 2&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong>: Semantic code.<br />
<strong>Cons</strong>: You may not always want the parent floated. Even if you do, do you float the parents' parent, and so on? Must you float every ancestor element?</p>
<h2>Solution 2</h2>
<p>Give the parent an explicit height.</p>
<p><div class=""snippet"" data-lang=""js"" data-hide=""false"" data-console=""true"" data-babel=""false"">
<div class=""snippet-code"">
<pre class=""snippet-code-html lang-html prettyprint-override""><code>&lt;div style=""height: 300px;""&gt;
  &lt;div style=""float: left;""&gt;Div 1&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div style=""float: left;""&gt;Div 2&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong>: Semantic code.<br />
<strong>Cons</strong>: Not flexible - if the content changes or the browser is resized, the layout will break.</p>
<h2>Solution 3</h2>
<p>Append a &quot;spacer&quot; element inside the parent element, like this:</p>
<p><div class=""snippet"" data-lang=""js"" data-hide=""false"" data-console=""true"" data-babel=""false"">
<div class=""snippet-code"">
<pre class=""snippet-code-html lang-html prettyprint-override""><code>&lt;div&gt;

  &lt;div style=""float: left;""&gt;Div 2&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class=""spacer"" style=""clear: both;""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong>: Straightforward to code.<br />
<strong>Cons</strong>: Not semantic; the spacer div exists only as a layout hack.</p>
<h2>Solution 4</h2>
<p>Set parent to <code>overflow: auto</code>.</p>
<p><div class=""snippet"" data-lang=""js"" data-hide=""false"" data-console=""true"" data-babel=""false"">
<div class=""snippet-code"">
<pre class=""snippet-code-html lang-html prettyprint-override""><code>&lt;div style=""overflow: auto;""&gt;
  &lt;div style=""float: left;""&gt;Div 1&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div style=""float: left;""&gt;Div 2&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong>: Doesn't require extra div.<br />
<strong>Cons</strong>: Seems like a hack - that's not the <code>overflow</code> property's stated purpose.</p>

<hr>

<p>This seems a bit bizarre to me, but as far as I can tell, this is how you do it.</p>

<p>I have a collection of objects, and I want users to select one or more of them.  This says to me ""form with checkboxes.""  My objects don't have any concept of ""selected"" (they're rudimentary POCO's formed by deserializing a wcf call).  So, I do the following:</p>

<pre><code>public class SampleObject{
  public Guid Id {get;set;}
  public string Name {get;set;}
}
</code></pre>

<p>In the view:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;%
    using (Html.BeginForm())
    {
%&gt;
  &lt;%foreach (var o in ViewData.Model) {%&gt;
    &lt;%=Html.CheckBox(o.Id)%&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;%= o.Name %&gt;
  &lt;%}%&gt;
  &lt;input type=""submit"" value=""Submit"" /&gt;
&lt;%}%&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And, in the controller, this is the only way I can see to figure out what objects the user checked:</p>

<pre><code>public ActionResult ThisLooksWeird(FormCollection result)
{
  var winnars = from x in result.AllKeys
          where result[x] != ""false""
          select x;
  // yadda
}
</code></pre>

<p>Its freaky in the first place, and secondly, for those items the user checked, the FormCollection lists its value as ""true false"" rather than just true.  </p>

<p>Obviously, I'm missing something.  I think this is built with the idea in mind that the objects in the collection that are acted upon within the html form are updated using <code>UpdateModel()</code> or through a ModelBinder.  </p>

<p>But my objects aren't set up for this; does that mean that this is the only way?  Is there another way to do it?</p>

Next, the actual question:
My team is restructuring our repository and I'm looking for hints on how to organize it. (SVN in this case).
Here's what we came up with. We have one repository, multiple projects and multiple svn:externals cross-references</p>

<pre><code>\commonTools /*tools used in all projects. Referenced in each project with svn:externals*/
   \NUnit.v2.4.8
   \NCover.v.1.5.8
   \&lt;other similar tools&gt;
\commonFiles /*settings strong name keys etc.*/
   \ReSharper.settings
   \VisualStudio.settings
\trash /*each member of the team has trash for samples, experiments etc*/
   \user1
   \user2
\projects
   \Solution1 /*Single actual project (Visual Studio Solution)*/
      \trunk
         \src
             \Project1 /*Each sub-project resulting in single .dll or .exe*/
             \Project2
         \lib
         \tools
         \tests
         \Solution1.sln
      \tags
      \branches
   \Solution2
      \trunk
         \src
             \Project3 /*Each sub-project resulting in single .dll or .exe*/
             \Project1 /*Project1 from Solution1 references with svn:externals*/
         \lib
         \tools
         \tests
         \Solution2.sln
      \tags
      \branches
</code></pre>

<p>To clear the vocabulary: Solution means single product, Project is a Visual Studio Project (that results in a single .dll or single .exe)</p>

<p>That's how we plan to lay out the repository. The main issue is, that we have multiple Solutions, but we want to share Projects among Solutions.
We thought that there is no point really in moving those shared Projects to their own Solutions, and instead we decided to use svn:externals to share Projects among Solutions. We also want to keep common set of tools and 3rd party libraries in one place in the repository, and them reference them in each Solution with svn:externals.</p>

<p>What do you think about this layout? Especially about the use of svn:externals. It's not an ideal solution, but considering all pros and cons, it's the best we could think of. How would YOU do it?</p>

  <p>Use a static class as a unit of
  organization for methods not
  associated with particular objects.
  Also, a static class can make your
  implementation simpler and faster
  because you do not have to create an
  object in order to call its methods.
  It is useful to organize the methods
  inside the class in a meaningful way,
  such as the methods of the Math class
  in the System namespace.</p>

Should my main() method be written to depend on the bean/application configuration to be in XML format - is that a safe assumption, or am I locking the user into something specific?</p>

"254281","<p>How do you properly override <code>isEqual:</code> in Objective-C?  The ""catch"" seems to be that if two objects are equal (as determined by the <code>isEqual:</code> method), they must have the same hash value.</p>

<p>The <a href=""http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CocoaFundamentals/CocoaObjects/CocoaObjects.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH4-SW25"" rel=""noreferrer"">Introspection</a> section of the <a href=""http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CocoaFundamentals/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Cocoa Fundamentals Guide</a> does have an example on how to override <code>isEqual:</code>, copied as follows, for a class named <code>MyWidget</code>:</p>

<pre><code>- (BOOL)isEqual:(id)other {
    if (other == self)
        return YES;
    if (!other || ![other isKindOfClass:[self class]])
        return NO;
    return [self isEqualToWidget:other];
}

- (BOOL)isEqualToWidget:(MyWidget *)aWidget {
    if (self == aWidget)
        return YES;
    if (![(id)[self name] isEqual:[aWidget name]])
        return NO;
    if (![[self data] isEqualToData:[aWidget data]])
        return NO;
    return YES;
}
</code></pre>

<p>It checks pointer equality, then class equality, and finally compares the objects using <code>isEqualToWidget:</code>, which only checks  the <code>name</code> and <code>data</code> properties.  What the example <em>doesn't</em> show is how to override <code>hash</code>.</p>

<p>Let's assume there are other properties that do not affect equality, say <code>age</code>.  Shouldn't the <code>hash</code> method be overridden such that only <code>name</code> and <code>data</code> affect the hash?  And if so, how would you do that? Just add the hashes of <code>name</code> and <code>data</code>?  For example:</p>

<pre><code>- (NSUInteger)hash {
    NSUInteger hash = 0;
    hash += [[self name] hash];
    hash += [[self data] hash];
    return hash;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Is that sufficient?  Is there a better technique?  What if you have primitives, like <code>int</code>?  Convert them to <code>NSNumber</code> to get their hash?  Or structs like <code>NSRect</code>?</p>

<li><p>Inheritance: extend the functionality of a class by creating a subclass. Override superclass members in the subclasses to provide new functionality.

"273695","<p>I've been using a local git repository interacting with my group's CVS repository for several months, now.  I've made an almost neurotic number of branches, most of which have thankfully merged back into my trunk.  But naming is starting to become an issue.  If I have a task easily named with a simple label, but I accomplish it in three stages which each include their own branch and merge situation, then I can repeat the branch name each time, but that makes the history a little confusing.  If I get more specific in the names, with a separate description for each stage, then the branch names start to get long and unwieldy.</p>

<p>I did learn looking through old threads here that I could start naming branches with a / in the name, i.e., topic/task, or something like that.  I may start doing that and seeing if it helps keep things better organized.</p>

<p>What are some best practices for naming git branches?</p>

<p>Edit:
Nobody has actually suggested any naming conventions.
I do delete branches when I'm done with them.  I just happen to have several around due to management constantly adjusting my priorities. :)
As an example of why I might need more than one branch on a task, suppose I need to commit the first discrete milestone in the task to the group's CVS repository.  At that point, due to my imperfect interaction with CVS, I would perform that commit and then kill that branch.  (I've seen too much weirdness interacting with CVS if I try to continue to use the same branch at that point.)</p>

<p>In our .sln, we have application A depending on assembly B which depends on assembly C.  In our case, there are dozens of ""B"" and a handful of ""C"".  Since these are all included in the .sln, we're using project references.  All assemblies currently build into $(SolutionDir)/Debug (or Release).</p>

<p>By default, Visual Studio marks these project references as ""Copy Local"", which results in    every ""C"" being copied into $(SolutionDir)/Debug once for every ""B"" that builds.  This seems wasteful.  What can go wrong if I just turn ""Copy Local"" off?  What do other people with large systems do?</p>

<p>FOLLOWUP:</p>

<p>Lots of responses suggest breaking up the build into smaller .sln files...  In the example above, I would build the foundation classes ""C"" first, followed by the bulk of the modules ""B"", and then a few applications, ""A"".  In this model, I need to have non-project references to C from B.  The problem I run into there is that ""Debug"" or ""Release"" gets baked into the hint path and I wind up building my Release builds of ""B"" against debug builds of ""C"".  </p>

Take your favorite language and tell me five things you hate about it. Those might be things that just annoy you, admitted design flaws, recognized performance problems, or any other category. You just have to hate it, and it has to be your favorite language.</p>

<p>Don't compare it to another language, and don't talk about languages that you already hate. Don't talk about the things you like in your favorite language. I just want to hear the things that you hate but tolerate so you can use all of the other stuff, and I want to hear it about the language you wished other people would use.</p>

<p>I ask this whenever someone tries to push their favorite language on me, and sometimes as an interview question. If someone can't find five things to hate about his favorite tool, he doesn't know it well enough to either advocate it or pull in the big dollars using it. He hasn't used it in enough different situations to fully explore it. He's advocating it as a culture or religion, which means that if I don't choose his favorite technology, I'm wrong.</p>

<p>I don't care that much which language you use. Don't want to use a particular language? Then don't. You go through due diligence to make an informed choice and still don't use it? Fine. Sometimes the right answer is ""You have a strong programming team with good practices and a lot of experience in Bar. Changing to Foo would be stupid.""</p>

<hr />

<p>This is a good question for code reviews too. People who really know a codebase will have all sorts of suggestions for it, and those who don't know it so well have non-specific complaints. I ask things like ""If you could start over on this project, what would you do differently?"" In this fantasy land, users and programmers get to complain about anything and everything they don't like. ""I want a better interface"", ""I want to separate the model from the view"", ""I'd use this module instead of this other one"", ""I'd rename this set of methods"", or whatever they really don't like about the current situation. That's how I get a handle on how much a particular developer knows about the codebase. It's also a clue about how much of the programmer's ego is tied up in what he's telling me.</p>

<p>Hate isn't the only dimension of figuring out how much people know, but I've found it to be a pretty good one. The things that they hate also give me a clue how well they are thinking about the subject.</p>

While I realize that the answers will be subjective, let's try to be as objective as we can and motivate the pros and cons we list.</p>

<p>Use the detail level you prefer for describing your architecture. For your answer to be of any value you'll at least have to describe the major technologies and ideas used in the architecture you describe. And last but not least, <em>when</em> should we use your architecture?</p>

<p>I'll start...</p>

<hr>

<h1>Overview of the architecture</h1>

<p>We use a 3-tier architecture based on open standards from Sun like Java EE, Java Persistence API, Servlet and Java Server Pages.</p>

<ul>
<li>Persistence</li>
<li>Business</li>
<li>Presentation</li>
</ul>

<p>The possible communication flows between the layers are represented by:</p>

<pre><code>Persistence &lt;-&gt; Business &lt;-&gt; Presentation
</code></pre>

<p>Which for example means that the presentation layer never calls or performs persistence operations, it always does it through the business layer. This architecture is meant to fulfill the demands of a high availability web application.</p>

<h2>Persistence</h2>

<p>Performs create, read, update and delete (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete"" rel=""noreferrer"">CRUD</a>) persistence operations. In our case we are using (<a href=""http://java.sun.com/javaee/technologies/persistence.jsp"" rel=""noreferrer"">Java Persistence API</a>) JPA and we currently use <a href=""http://www.hibernate.org/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Hibernate</a> as our persistence provider and use <a href=""http://www.hibernate.org/397.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">its EntityManager</a>.</p>

<p>This layer is divided into multiple classes, where each class deals with a certain type of entities (i.e. entities related to a shopping cart might get handled by a single persistence class) and is <em>used</em> by one and only one <em>manager</em>.</p>

<p>In addition this layer also stores <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Persistence_API#Entities"" rel=""noreferrer"">JPA entities</a> which are things like <code>Account</code>, <code>ShoppingCart</code> etc.</p>

<h2>Business</h2>

<p>All logic which is tied to the web application functionality is located in this layer. This functionality could be initiating a money transfer for a customer who wants to pay for a product on-line using her/his credit card. It could just as well be creating a new user, deleting a user or calculating the outcome of a battle in a web based game.</p>

<p>This layer is divided into multiple classes and each of these classes is annotated with <code>@Stateless</code> to become a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_Beans"" rel=""noreferrer"">Stateless Session Bean</a> (SLSB). Each SLSB is called a <em>manager</em> and for instance a manager could be a class annotated as mentioned called <code>AccountManager</code>.</p>

<p>When <code>AccountManager</code> needs to perform CRUD operations it makes the appropriate calls to an instance of <code>AccountManagerPersistence</code>, which is a class in the persistence layer. A rough sketch of two methods in <code>AccountManager</code> could be:</p>

<pre><code>...
public void makeExpiredAccountsInactive() {
    AccountManagerPersistence amp = new AccountManagerPersistence(...)
    // Calls persistence layer
    List&lt;Account&gt; expiredAccounts = amp.getAllExpiredAccounts();
    for(Account account : expiredAccounts) {
        this.makeAccountInactive(account)
    }
}
public void makeAccountInactive(Account account) {
    AccountManagerPersistence amp = new AccountManagerPersistence(...)
    account.deactivate();
    amp.storeUpdatedAccount(account); // Calls persistence layer
}
</code></pre>

<p>We use <a href=""http://java.sun.com/javaee/5/docs/tutorial/doc/bncij.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">container manager transactions</a> so we don't have to do transaction demarcation our self's. What basically happens under the hood is we initiate a transaction when entering the SLSB method and commit it (or rollback it) immediately before exiting the method. It's an example of convention over configuration, but we haven't had a need for anything but the default, Required, yet.</p>

<p>Here is how The Java EE 5 Tutorial from Sun explains the <a href=""http://java.sun.com/javaee/5/docs/tutorial/doc/bncij.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Required transaction attribute</a> for Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB's):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If the client is running within a
  transaction and invokes the enterprise
  bean’s method, the method executes
  within the client’s transaction. If
  the client is not associated with a
  transaction, the container starts a
  new transaction before running the
  method.</p>
  
  <p>The Required attribute is the implicit
  transaction attribute for all
  enterprise bean methods running with
  container-managed transaction
  demarcation. You typically do not set
  the Required attribute unless you need
  to override another transaction
  attribute. Because transaction
  attributes are declarative, you can
  easily change them later.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Presentation</h2>

<p>Our presentation layer is in charge of... presentation! It's responsible for the user interface and shows information to the user by building HTML pages and receiving user input through GET and POST requests. We are currently using the old <a href=""http://java.sun.com/products/servlet/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Servlet</a>'s + Java Server Pages (<a href=""http://java.sun.com/products/jsp/"" rel=""noreferrer"">JSP</a>) combination.</p>

<p>The layer calls methods in <em>managers</em> of the business layer to perform operations requested by the user and to receive information to show in the web page. Sometimes the information received from the business layer are less complex types as <code>String</code>'s and <code>int</code>egers, and at other times <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Persistence_API#Entities"" rel=""noreferrer"">JPA entities</a>.</p>

<h1>Pros and cons with the architecture</h1>

<h2>Pros</h2>

<ul>
<li>Having everything related to a specific way of doing persistence in this layer only means we can swap from using JPA into something else, without having to re-write anything in the business layer.</li>
<li>It's easy for us to swap our presentation layer into something else, and it's likely that we will if we find something better.</li>
<li>Letting the EJB container manage transaction boundaries is nice.</li>
<li>Using Servlet's + JPA is easy (to begin with) and the technologies are widely used and implemented in lots of servers.</li>
<li>Using Java EE is supposed to make it easier for us to create a high availability system with <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load_balancing_(computing)"" rel=""noreferrer"">load balancing</a> and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Failover"" rel=""noreferrer"">fail over</a>. Both of which we feel that we must have.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Cons</h2>

<ul>
<li>Using JPA you may store often used queries as named queries by using the <code>@NamedQuery</code> annotation on the JPA entity class. If you have as much as possible related to persistence in the persistence classes, as in our architecture, this will spread out the locations where you may find queries to include the JPA entities as well. It will be harder to overview persistence operations and thus harder to maintain.</li>
<li>We have JPA entities as part of our persistence layer. But <code>Account</code> and <code>ShoppingCart</code>, aren't they really business objects? It is done this way as you have to touch these classes and turn them into entities which JPA knows how to handle.</li>
<li>The JPA entities, which are also our business objects, are created like Data Transfer Objects (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Transfer_Object"" rel=""noreferrer"">DTO</a>'s), also known as Value Objects (VO's). This results in an <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemic_Domain_Model"" rel=""noreferrer"">anemic domain model</a> as the business objects have no logic of their own except accessor methods. All logic is done by our managers in the business layer, which results in a more procedural programming style. It's not good object oriented design, but maybe that's not a problem? (After all object orientation isn't the only programming paradigm which has delivered results.)</li>
<li>Using EJB and Java EE introduces a bit of complexity. And we can't use purely Tomcat (adding an EJB micro-container isn't <em>purely</em> Tomcat).</li>
<li>There are lots of issues with using Servlet's + JPA. Use Google for more information about these issues.</li>
<li>As the transactions are closed when exiting the business layer we can't load any information from JPA entities which is configured to be loaded from the database when it's needed (using <code>fetch=FetchType.LAZY</code>) from inside the presentation layer. It will trigger an exception. Before returning an entity containing these kinds of fields we have to be sure to call the relevant getter's. Another option is to use Java Persistence Query Language (<a href=""http://java.sun.com/javaee/5/docs/tutorial/doc/bnbtg.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">JPQL</a>) and do a <code>FETCH JOIN</code>. However both of these options are a little bit cumbersome.</li>

<li>tinyint, varchar fields containing the values 0/1,</li>

<p>And the <code>views.py</code> is also basic:</p>

    else:

    return render_to_response('addclient.html', {'form': form, 'the_company':the_company})

<hr>

<p>I've tried the different solutions to the problem:</p>

<ul>
<li>After exhaustive testing, I found that adding <code>0.5</code> to the result of Math.sqrt() is not necessary, at least not on my machine.</li>
<li>The <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_inverse_square_root"" rel=""noreferrer"">fast inverse square root</a> was faster, but it gave incorrect results for n >= 410881.  However, as suggested by <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/users/38426/bobbyshaftoe"">BobbyShaftoe</a>, we can use the FISR hack for n &lt; 410881.</li>
<li>Newton's method was a good bit slower than <code>Math.sqrt()</code>.  This is probably because <code>Math.sqrt()</code> uses something similar to Newton's Method, but implemented in the hardware so it's much faster than in Java.  Also, Newton's Method still required use of doubles.</li>
<li>A modified Newton's method, which used a few tricks so that only integer math was involved, required some hacks to avoid overflow (I want this function to work with all positive 64-bit signed integers), and it was still slower than <code>Math.sqrt()</code>.</li>
<li>Binary chop was even slower.  This makes sense because the binary chop will on average require 16 passes to find the square root of a 64-bit number.</li>
<li>According to John's tests, using <code>or</code> statements is faster in C++ than using a <code>switch</code>, but in Java and C# there appears to be no difference between <code>or</code> and <code>switch</code>.</li>
<li>I also tried making a lookup table (as a private static array of 64 boolean values).  Then instead of either switch or <code>or</code> statement, I would just say <code>if(lookup[(int)(n&amp;0x3F)]) { test } else return false;</code>.  To my surprise, this was (just slightly) slower. This is because <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/299079/why-is-this-code-with-several-or-statements-slightly-faster-than-using-a-lookup-t#299205"">array bounds are checked in Java</a>. </li>

"299068","<p>Question:  Is exception handling in Java actually slow?</p>

<p>Conventional wisdom, as well as a lot of Google results, says that exceptional logic shouldn't be used for normal program flow in Java.  Two reasons are usually given,</p>

<ol>
<li>it is really slow - even an order of magnitude slower than regular code (the reasons given vary),  </li>
</ol>

<p>and </p>

<ol start=""2"">
<li>it is messy because people expect only errors to be handled in exceptional code.  </li>
</ol>

<p>This question is about #1.</p>

<p>As an example, <a href=""http://leepoint.net/notes-java/flow/exceptions/03exceptions.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">this page</a> describes Java exception handling as ""very slow"" and relates the slowness to the creation of the exception message string - ""this string is then used in creating the exception object that is thrown. This is not fast.""  The article <a href=""http://adtmag.com/articles/2000/08/22/effective-exception-handling-in-java.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">Effective Exception Handling in Java</a> says that ""the reason for this is due to the object creation aspect of exception handling, which thereby makes throwing exceptions inherently slow"".  Another reason out there is that the stack trace generation is what slows it down.</p>

<p>My testing (using Java 1.6.0_07, Java HotSpot 10.0, on 32 bit Linux), indicates that exception handling is no slower than regular code.  I tried running a method in a loop that executes some code.  At the end of the method, I use a boolean to indicate whether to <em>return</em> or <em>throw</em>.  This way the actual processing is the same. I tried running the methods in different orders and averaging my test times, thinking it may have been the JVM warming up.  In all my tests, the throw was at least as fast as the return, if not faster (up to 3.1% faster).  I am completely open to the possibility that my tests were wrong, but I haven't seen anything out there in the way of the code sample, test comparisons, or results in the last year or two that show exception handling in Java to actually be slow.</p>

<p>What leads me down this path was an API I needed to use that threw exceptions as part of normal control logic.  I wanted to correct them in their usage, but now I may not be able to.  Will I instead have to praise them on their forward thinking?</p>

<p>In the paper <a href=""http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=337453"" rel=""noreferrer"">Efficient Java exception handling in just-in-time compilation</a>, the authors suggest that the presence of exception handlers alone, even if no exceptions are thrown, is enough to prevent the JIT compiler from optimizing the code properly, thus slowing it down.

"301134","<p>I'm writing a Python application that takes as a command as an argument, for example:</p>

<pre><code>$ python myapp.py command1
</code></pre>

<p>I want the application to be extensible, that is, to be able to add new modules that implement new commands without having to change the main application source. The tree looks something like:</p>

<pre><code>myapp/
    __init__.py
    commands/
        __init__.py
        command1.py
        command2.py
    foo.py
    bar.py
</code></pre>

<p>So I want the application to find the available command modules at runtime and execute the appropriate one.</p>

<p>Python defines an <strong>__import__</strong> function, which takes a string for a module name:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>__import__(name, globals=None, locals=None, fromlist=(), level=0)</p>
  
  <p>The function imports the module name, potentially using the given globals and locals to determine how to interpret the name in a package context. The fromlist gives the names of objects or submodules that should be imported from the module given by name. </p>
  
  <p>Source: <a href=""https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#__import__"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#<strong>import</strong></a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So currently I have something like:</p>

<pre><code>command = sys.argv[1]
try:
    command_module = __import__(""myapp.commands.%s"" % command, fromlist=[""myapp.commands""])
except ImportError:
    # Display error message

command_module.run()
</code></pre>

<p>This works just fine, I'm just wondering if there is possibly a more idiomatic way to accomplish what we are doing with this code.</p>

<p>Note that I specifically don't want to get in to using eggs or extension points. This is not an open-source project and I don't expect there to be ""plugins"". The point is to simplify the main application code and remove the need to modify it each time a new command module is added.</p>

<p>So what I need is a beginner's <strong>practical</strong> guide to Git.  ""Beginner"" being defined as someone who knows how to handle their compiler, understands to some level what a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_%28software%29"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Makefile</a> is, and has touched source control without understanding it very well.</p>

<p>""Practical"" being defined as this person doesn't want to get into great detail regarding what Git is doing in the background, and doesn't even care (or know) that it's distributed.  Your answers might hint at the possibilities, but try to aim for the beginner that wants to keep a 'main' repository on a 'server' which is backed up and secure, and treat their local repository as merely a 'client' resource.</p>

"316780","<p>I'm developing a multilanguage software. As far as the application code goes, localizability is not an issue. We can use language specific resources and have all kinds of tools that work well with them.</p>

<p>But what is the best approach in defining a multilanguage database schema? Let's say we have a lot of tables (100 or more), and each table can have multiple columns that can be localized (most of nvarchar columns should be localizable). For instance one of the tables might hold product information:</p>

<pre class=""lang-sql prettyprint-override""><code>CREATE TABLE T_PRODUCT (
  NAME        NVARCHAR(50),
  DESCRIPTION NTEXT,
  PRICE       NUMBER(18, 2)
)
</code></pre>

<p>I can think of three approaches to support multilingual text in NAME and DESCRIPTION columns:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Separate column for each language</p>

<p>When we add a new language to the system, we must create additional columns to store the translated text, like this:</p>

<pre class=""lang-sql prettyprint-override""><code>CREATE TABLE T_PRODUCT (
  NAME_EN        NVARCHAR(50),
  NAME_DE        NVARCHAR(50),
  NAME_SP        NVARCHAR(50),
  DESCRIPTION_EN NTEXT,
  DESCRIPTION_DE NTEXT,
  DESCRIPTION_SP NTEXT,
  PRICE          NUMBER(18,2)
)
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Translation table with columns for each language</p>

<p>Instead of storing translated text, only a foreign key to the translations table is stored. The translations table contains a column for each language.</p>

<pre class=""lang-sql prettyprint-override""><code>CREATE TABLE T_PRODUCT (
  NAME_FK        int,
  DESCRIPTION_FK int,
  PRICE          NUMBER(18, 2)
)

CREATE TABLE T_TRANSLATION (
  TRANSLATION_ID,
  TEXT_EN NTEXT,
  TEXT_DE NTEXT,
  TEXT_SP NTEXT
)
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Translation tables with rows for each language</p>

<p>Instead of storing translated text, only a foreign key to the translations table is stored. The translations table contains only a key, and a separate table contains a row for each translation to a language.</p>

<pre class=""lang-sql prettyprint-override""><code>CREATE TABLE T_PRODUCT (
  NAME_FK        int,
  DESCRIPTION_FK int,
  PRICE          NUMBER(18, 2)
)

CREATE TABLE T_TRANSLATION (
  TRANSLATION_ID
)

CREATE TABLE T_TRANSLATION_ENTRY (
  TRANSLATION_FK,
  LANGUAGE_FK,
  TRANSLATED_TEXT NTEXT
)

CREATE TABLE T_TRANSLATION_LANGUAGE (
  LANGUAGE_ID,
  LANGUAGE_CODE CHAR(2)
)
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<p>There are pros and cons to each solution, and I would like to know what are your experiences with these approaches, what do you recommend and how would you go about designing a multilanguage database schema.</p>

One article I found <a href=""http://www.defmacro.org/ramblings/fp.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">makes a fairly strong claim</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Most people I've met have read 
  <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns"" rel=""noreferrer"">the Design Patterns book</a> by the Gang of
  Four (GoF). Any self respecting programmer
  will tell you that the book is
  language agnostic and the patterns
  apply to software engineering in
  general, regardless of which language
  you use. This is a noble claim.
  Unfortunately it is far removed from
  the truth.</p>
  
  <p>Functional languages are extremely
  expressive. <strong>In a functional language
  one does not need design patterns
  because the language is likely so high
  level, you end up programming in
  concepts that eliminate design
  patterns all together.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The main features of functional programming (FP) include functions as first-class values, currying, immutable values, etc. It doesn't seem obvious to me that OO design patterns are approximating any of those features.</p>

<p>Additionally, in functional languages which support OOP (such as F# and OCaml), it seems obvious to me that programmers using these languages would use the same design patterns found available to every other OOP language. In fact, right now I use F# and OCaml every day, and there are no striking differences between the patterns I use in these languages vs. the patterns I use when I write in Java.</p>

<p>Is there any truth to the claim that functional programming eliminates the need for OOP design patterns? If so, could you post or link to an example of a typical OOP design pattern and its functional equivalent?</p>

"328356","<p>I'd like to extract the text from an HTML file using Python.  I want essentially the same output I would get if I copied the text from a browser and pasted it into notepad.  </p>

<p>I'd like something more robust than using regular expressions that may fail on poorly formed HTML.  I've seen many people recommend Beautiful Soup, but I've had a few problems using it.  For one, it picked up unwanted text, such as JavaScript source.  Also, it did not interpret HTML entities.  For example, I would expect &amp;#39; in HTML source to be converted to an apostrophe in text, just as if I'd pasted the browser content into notepad.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong> <code>html2text</code> looks promising. It handles HTML entities correctly and ignores JavaScript.  However, it does not exactly produce plain text; it produces markdown that would then have to be turned into plain text. It comes with no examples or documentation, but the code looks clean.</p>

<ol>
<li>Identity integer column that auto increments.</li>
<li>Unique identifier (GUID)</li>
<li>A short character(x) or integer (or other relatively small numeric type) column that can serve as a row identifier column</li>
</ol>
<p>Number 3 would be used for fairly small lookup, mostly read tables that might have a unique static length string code, or a numeric value such as a year or other number.</p>
<p>For the most part, all other tables will either have an auto-incrementing integer or unique identifier primary key.</p>

<p><strong>When does type erasure occur?</strong> At compile time or runtime? When the class is loaded? When the class is instantiated?</p>

<p>A lot of sites (including the official tutorial mentioned above) say type erasure occurs at compile time. If the type information is completely removed at compile time, how does the JDK check type compatibility when a method using generics is invoked with no type information or wrong type information?</p>

<p>Consider the following example: Say class <code>A</code> has a method, <code>empty(Box&lt;?&nbsp;extends&nbsp;Number&gt;&nbsp;b)</code>. We compile <code>A.java</code> and get the class file <code>A.class</code>.</p>

<pre><code>public class A {
    public static void empty(Box&lt;? extends Number&gt; b) {}
}
</code></pre>



<pre><code>public class Box&lt;T&gt; {}
</code></pre>

<p>Now we create another class <code>B</code> which invokes the method <code>empty</code> with a non-parameterized argument (raw type): <code>empty(new Box())</code>. If we compile <code>B.java</code> with <code>A.class</code> in the classpath, javac is smart enough to raise a warning. So <code>A.class</code> <em>has</em> some type information stored in it.</p>

<pre><code>public class B {
    public static void invoke() {
        // java: unchecked method invocation:
        //  method empty in class A is applied to given types
        //  required: Box&lt;? extends java.lang.Number&gt;
        //  found:    Box
        // java: unchecked conversion
        //  required: Box&lt;? extends java.lang.Number&gt;
        //  found:    Box
        A.empty(new Box());
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>My guess would be that type erasure occurs when the class is loaded, but it is just a guess. So when does it happen? </p>

&lt;%= link_to('Text', thing_path(thing)) %&gt;
&lt;% else %&gt;

"345838","<p>With the help of the Stack Overflow community I've written a pretty basic-but fun physics simulator.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/EeqSP.png"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>You click and drag the mouse to launch a ball.  It will bounce around and eventually stop on the ""floor"".</p>

<p>My next big feature I want to add in is ball to ball collision.  The ball's movement is broken up into a x and y speed vector.  I have gravity (small reduction of the y vector each step), I have friction (small reduction of both vectors each collision with a wall). The balls honestly move around in a surprisingly realistic way.</p>

<p>I guess my question has two parts:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>What is the best method to detect ball to ball collision?</strong><br>
Do I just have an O(n^2) loop that iterates over each ball and checks every other ball to see if it's radius overlaps?</li>
<li><strong>What equations do I use to handle the ball to ball collisions? Physics 101</strong><br>
How does it effect the two balls speed x/y vectors?  What is the resulting direction the two balls head off in?  How do I apply this to each ball?</li>
</ol>

<p><img src=""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2c/Elastischer_sto%C3%9F_2D.gif"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>Handling the collision detection of the ""walls"" and the resulting vector changes were easy but I see more complications with ball-ball collisions.  With walls I simply had to take the negative of the appropriate x or y vector and off it would go in the correct direction.  With balls I don't think it is that way.</p>

<p>Some quick clarifications: for simplicity I'm ok with a perfectly elastic collision for now, also all my balls have the same mass right now, but I might change that in the future.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Success!</h2>

<p>I have the ball collision detection and response working great!</p>

<p>Relevant code:</p>

<p>Collision Detection:</p>

<pre><code>for (int i = 0; i &lt; ballCount; i++)  
{  
    for (int j = i + 1; j &lt; ballCount; j++)  
    {  
        if (balls[i].colliding(balls[j]))  
        {
            balls[i].resolveCollision(balls[j]);
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This will check for collisions between every ball but skip redundant checks (if you have to check if ball 1 collides with ball 2 then you don't need to check if ball 2 collides with ball 1.  Also, it skips checking for collisions with itself).</p>

<p>Then, in my ball class I have my colliding() and resolveCollision() methods:</p>

<pre><code>public boolean colliding(Ball ball)
{
    float xd = position.getX() - ball.position.getX();
    float yd = position.getY() - ball.position.getY();

    float sumRadius = getRadius() + ball.getRadius();
    float sqrRadius = sumRadius * sumRadius;

    float distSqr = (xd * xd) + (yd * yd);

    if (distSqr &lt;= sqrRadius)
    {
        return true;
    }

    return false;
}

public void resolveCollision(Ball ball)
{
    // get the mtd
    Vector2d delta = (position.subtract(ball.position));
    float d = delta.getLength();
    // minimum translation distance to push balls apart after intersecting
    Vector2d mtd = delta.multiply(((getRadius() + ball.getRadius())-d)/d); 


    // resolve intersection --
    // inverse mass quantities
    float im1 = 1 / getMass(); 
    float im2 = 1 / ball.getMass();

    // push-pull them apart based off their mass
    position = position.add(mtd.multiply(im1 / (im1 + im2)));
    ball.position = ball.position.subtract(mtd.multiply(im2 / (im1 + im2)));

    // impact speed
    Vector2d v = (this.velocity.subtract(ball.velocity));
    float vn = v.dot(mtd.normalize());

    // sphere intersecting but moving away from each other already
    if (vn &gt; 0.0f) return;

    // collision impulse
    float i = (-(1.0f + Constants.restitution) * vn) / (im1 + im2);
    Vector2d impulse = mtd.normalize().multiply(i);

    // change in momentum
    this.velocity = this.velocity.add(impulse.multiply(im1));
    ball.velocity = ball.velocity.subtract(impulse.multiply(im2));

}

<p>Here is how I use them:</p>

<p><strong>Fake</strong>: a class that implements an interface but contains fixed data and no logic.  Simply returns ""good"" or ""bad"" data depending on the implementation.</p>

<p><strong>Mock</strong>: a class that implements an interface and allows the ability to dynamically set the values to return/exceptions to throw from particular methods and provides the ability to check if particular methods have been called/not called.</p>

<p><strong>Stub</strong>: Like a mock class, except that it doesn't provide the ability to verify that methods have been called/not called.</p>

<p>Mocks and stubs can be hand generated or generated by a mocking framework.  Fake classes are generated by hand.  I use mocks primarily to verify interactions between my class and dependent classes.  I use stubs once I have verified the interactions and am testing alternate paths through my code.  I use fake classes primarily to abstract out data dependencies or when mocks/stubs are too tedious to set up each time.</p>

<p>With my helper function having the signature of <code>private ListNode reverse(ListNode current)</code>.</p>

<p>At the moment, I have it working iteratively using a stack, but this is not what the specification requires. I had found an algorithm in C that recursively reversed and converted it to Java code by hand, and it worked, but I had no understanding of it.</p>

<p>Edit: Nevermind, I figured it out in the meantime.</p>

<pre><code>private AddressList reverse(ListNode current, AddressList reversedList){
  if(current == null) 
      return reversedList;
  reversedList.addToFront(current.getData());
  return this.reverse(current.getNext(), reversedList);

"354883","<p>The canonical way to return multiple values in languages that support it is often <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38508/whats-the-best-way-to-return-multiple-values-from-a-function-in-python"">tupling</a>.</p>
<h3>Option: Using a tuple</h3>
<p>Consider this trivial example:</p>
<pre><code>def f(x):
  y0 = x + 1
  y1 = x * 3
  y2 = y0 ** y3
  return (y0, y1, y2)
</code></pre>
<p>However, this quickly gets problematic as the number of values returned increases. What if you want to return four or five values? Sure, you could keep tupling them, but it gets easy to forget which value is where. It's also rather ugly to unpack them wherever you want to receive them.</p>
<h3>Option: Using a dictionary</h3>
<p>The next logical step seems to be to introduce some sort of 'record notation'. In Python, the obvious way to do this is by means of a <code>dict</code>.</p>
<p>Consider the following:</p>
<pre><code>def g(x):
  y0 = x + 1
  y1 = x * 3
  y2 = y0 ** y3
  return {'y0': y0, 'y1': y1 ,'y2': y2}
</code></pre>
<p>(Just to be clear, y0, y1, and y2 are just meant as abstract identifiers. As pointed out, in practice you'd use meaningful identifiers.)</p>
<p>Now, we have a mechanism whereby we can project out a particular member of the returned object. For example,</p>
<pre><code>result['y0']
</code></pre>
<h3>Option: Using a class</h3>
<p>However, there is another option. We could instead return a specialized structure. I've framed this in the context of Python, but I'm sure it applies to other languages as well. Indeed, if you were working in C this might very well be your only option. Here goes:</p>
<pre><code>class ReturnValue:
  def __init__(self, y0, y1, y2):
     self.y0 = y0
     self.y1 = y1
     self.y2 = y2

def g(x):
  y0 = x + 1
  y1 = x * 3
  y2 = y0 ** y3
  return ReturnValue(y0, y1, y2)
</code></pre>
<p>In Python the previous two are perhaps very similar in terms of plumbing - after all <code>{ y0, y1, y2 }</code> just end up being entries in the internal <code>__dict__</code> of the <code>ReturnValue</code>.</p>
<p>There is one additional feature provided by Python though for tiny objects, the <code>__slots__</code> attribute. The class could be expressed as:</p>
<pre><code>class ReturnValue(object):
  __slots__ = [&quot;y0&quot;, &quot;y1&quot;, &quot;y2&quot;]
  def __init__(self, y0, y1, y2):
     self.y0 = y0
     self.y1 = y1
     self.y2 = y2
</code></pre>
<p>From the <a href=""http://www.network-theory.co.uk/docs/pylang/__slots__.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Python Reference Manual</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <code>__slots__</code> declaration takes a sequence of instance variables and reserves just enough space in each instance to hold a value for each variable. Space is saved because <code>__dict__</code> is not created for each instance.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Option: Using a <a href=""https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">dataclass</a> (Python 3.7+)</h3>
<p>Using Python 3.7's new dataclasses, return a class with automatically added special methods, typing and other useful tools:</p>
<pre><code>@dataclass
class Returnvalue:
    y0: int
    y1: float
    y3: int

def total_cost(x):
    y0 = x + 1
    y1 = x * 3
    y2 = y0 ** y3
    return ReturnValue(y0, y1, y2)
</code></pre>
<h3>Option: Using a list</h3>
<p>Another suggestion which I'd overlooked comes from Bill the Lizard:</p>
<pre><code>def h(x):
  result = [x + 1]
  result.append(x * 3)
  result.append(y0 ** y3)
  return result
</code></pre>
<p>This is my least favorite method though. I suppose I'm tainted by exposure to Haskell, but the idea of mixed-type lists has always felt uncomfortable to me. In this particular example the list is -not- mixed type, but it conceivably could be.</p>
<p>A list used in this way really doesn't gain anything with respect to the tuple as far as I can tell. The only real difference between lists and tuples in Python is that lists are <a href=""http://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html#typesseq-mutable"" rel=""noreferrer"">mutable</a>, whereas tuples are not.</p>
<p>I personally tend to carry over the conventions from functional programming: use lists for any number of elements of the same type, and tuples for a fixed number of elements of predetermined types.</p>

This has been reported to result in fewer merge conflicts without causing mis-merges by tests done on actual merge commits taken from Linux 2.6 kernel development history. Additionally this can detect and handle merges involving renames. This is the default merge strategy when pulling or merging one branch.</p></li>
<li><p><em>octopus</em> - 
This resolves more than two-head case, but refuses to do complex merge that needs manual resolution. It is primarily meant to be used for bundling topic branch heads together. This is the default merge strategy when pulling or merging more than one branches.</p></li>
<li><p><em>ours</em> - 
This resolves any number of heads, but the result of the merge is always the current branch head. It is meant to be used to supersede old development history of side branches.</p></li>
<li><p><em>subtree</em> - 
This is a modified recursive strategy. When merging trees A and B, if B corresponds to a subtree of A, B is first adjusted to match the tree structure of A, instead of reading the trees at the same level. This adjustment is also done to the common ancestor tree.</p></li>

However, <strong>when I load <code>someform.asp</code> as an IFRAME in IE 6 or IE 7, the cookies for example.com are not saved.</strong> In Firefox this problem doesn't appear.</p>

"390250","<p>When writing custom classes it is often important to allow equivalence by means of the <code>==</code> and <code>!=</code> operators. In Python, this is made possible by implementing the <code>__eq__</code> and <code>__ne__</code> special methods, respectively. The easiest way I've found to do this is the following method:</p>

<pre><code>class Foo:
    def __init__(self, item):
        self.item = item

    def __eq__(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, self.__class__):
            return self.__dict__ == other.__dict__
        else:
            return False

    def __ne__(self, other):
        return not self.__eq__(other)
</code></pre>

<p>Do you know of more elegant means of doing this? Do you know of any particular disadvantages to using the above method of comparing <code>__dict__</code>s?</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: A bit of clarification--when <code>__eq__</code> and <code>__ne__</code> are undefined, you'll find this behavior:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = Foo(1)
&gt;&gt;&gt; b = Foo(1)
&gt;&gt;&gt; a is b
False
&gt;&gt;&gt; a == b
False
</code></pre>

<p>That is, <code>a == b</code> evaluates to <code>False</code> because it really runs <code>a is b</code>, a test of identity (i.e., ""Is <code>a</code> the same object as <code>b</code>?"").</p>

<p>When <code>__eq__</code> and <code>__ne__</code> are defined, you'll find this behavior (which is the one we're after):</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = Foo(1)
&gt;&gt;&gt; b = Foo(1)
&gt;&gt;&gt; a is b
False
&gt;&gt;&gt; a == b
True

<p>I tried to flatten such a list with a nested list comprehension, like this:</p>

<pre><code>[image for image in menuitem for menuitem in list_of_menuitems]
</code></pre>

<p>But I get in trouble of the <code>NameError</code> variety there, because the <code>name 'menuitem' is not defined</code>.  After googling and looking around on Stack Overflow, I got the desired results with a <code>reduce</code> statement:</p>

<pre><code>reduce(list.__add__, map(lambda x: list(x), list_of_menuitems))
</code></pre>

<p>But this method is fairly unreadable because I need that <code>list(x)</code> call there because x is a Django <code>QuerySet</code> object.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>: </p>

<p>Thanks to everyone who contributed to this question.  Here is a summary of what I learned.  I'm also making this a community wiki in case others want to add to or correct these observations.</p>

<p>My original reduce statement is redundant and is better written this way:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; reduce(list.__add__, (list(mi) for mi in list_of_menuitems))
</code></pre>

<p>This is the correct syntax for a nested list comprehension (Brilliant summary <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/users/3002/df"">dF</a>!):</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; [image for mi in list_of_menuitems for image in mi]
</code></pre>

<p>But neither of these methods are as efficient as using <code>itertools.chain</code>:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; from itertools import chain
&gt;&gt;&gt; list(chain(*list_of_menuitems))
</code></pre>

<p>And as @cdleary notes, it's probably better style to avoid * operator magic by using <code>chain.from_iterable</code> like so:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; chain = itertools.chain.from_iterable([[1,2],[3],[5,89],[],[6]])
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(list(chain))

"407255","<p>I have always wondered if, in general, declaring a throw-away variable before a loop, as opposed to repeatedly inside the loop, makes any (performance) difference? 
A <em>(quite pointless)</em> example in Java:</p>

<p><strong>a)</strong> declaration before loop:</p>

<pre><code>double intermediateResult;
for(int i=0; i &lt; 1000; i++){
    intermediateResult = i;
    System.out.println(intermediateResult);
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>b)</strong> declaration (repeatedly) inside loop:</p>

<pre><code>for(int i=0; i &lt; 1000; i++){
    double intermediateResult = i;
    System.out.println(intermediateResult);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Which one is better, <strong>a</strong> or <strong>b</strong>? </p>

<p>I suspect that repeated variable declaration (example <strong>b</strong>) creates more overhead <em>in theory</em>, but that compilers are smart enough so that it doesn't matter. Example <strong>b</strong> has the advantage of being more compact and limiting the scope of the variable to where it is used. Still, I tend to code according example <strong>a</strong>.</p>

"409563","<p>I'm stuck deciding how to handle exceptions in my application. </p>

<p>Much if my issues with exceptions comes from 1) accessing data via a remote service or 2) deserializing a JSON object. Unfortunately I can't guarantee success for either of these tasks (cut network connection, malformed JSON object that is out of my control). </p>

<p>As a result, if I do encounter an exception I simply catch it within the function and return FALSE to the caller. My logic is that all the caller really cares about is if the task was successful, not why it is wasn't successful.</p>

<p>Here's some sample code (in JAVA) of a typical method)</p>

<pre><code>public boolean doSomething(Object p_somthingToDoOn)
{
    boolean result = false;

    try{
        // if dirty object then clean
        doactualStuffOnObject(p_jsonObject);

        //assume success (no exception thrown)
        result = true;
    }
    catch(Exception Ex)
    {
        //don't care about exceptions
        Ex.printStackTrace();
    }
    return result;
}
</code></pre>

<p>I think this approach is fine, but I'm really curious to know what the best practices are for managing exceptions (should I really bubble an exception all the way up a call stack?). </p>

<p><strong>In summary of key questions:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Is it okay to just catch exceptions but not bubble them up or formally notifying the system (either via a log or a notification to the user)?</li>
<li>What best practices are there for exceptions that don't result in everything requiring a try/catch block?</li>
</ol>

<p>It seems that exception management is one of those things that vary based on context. But most importantly, one should be consistent in how they manage exceptions within a system. </p>

<p>Additionally watch out for code-rot via excessive try/catches or not giving a exception its respect (an exception is warning the system, what else needs to be warned?).</p>

<p>From this comment it brings up some questions to think about when dealing with exceptions:</p>

<ul>
<li>What is the point this exception being thrown?</li>
<li>How does it make sense to handle it? </li>
<li>Does the caller really care about the exception or do they just care if the call was successful?</li>
<li>Is forcing a caller to manage a potential exception graceful?</li>
<li><strong><em>Are you being respectful to the idoms of the language?</em></strong> 

<ul>
<li>Do you really need to return a success flag like boolean? Returning boolean (or an int) is more of a C mindset than a Java (in Java you would just handle the exception) one. </li>

<p>Situation is quite simple - server is the central node, that multiple clients connect to and manipulate same data.

<p>Below is how i now think to solve it:
Parallel to data, a modification journal will be held, having all transactions timestamped. 
When client connects, it receives all changes since last check, in consolidated form (server goes through lists and removes additions that are followed by deletions, merges updates for each atom, etc.).
Et voila, we are up to date.</p>

<p>Basically I want to update three out of four columns if the record exists, 
If it does not exists I want to INSERT the record with the default (NUL) value for the fourth column.</p>

<p>The ID is a primary key so there will only ever be one record to UPSERT.</p>

<hr>

<p>I cannot confirm that Syntax on the SQLite site for TABLE CREATE.
I have not built a demo to test it, but It doesnt seem to be supported..</p>

<p>If it was, I have three columns so it would actually look like:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE table1( 
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY ON CONFLICT REPLACE, 
    Blob1 BLOB ON CONFLICT REPLACE, 
    Blob2 BLOB ON CONFLICT REPLACE, 
    Blob3 BLOB

So I asusme Blob1 and Blob2 would not be replaced (as desired)</p>

<p>UPDATEs in SQLite when binding data are a complete transaction, meaning 
Each sent row to be updated requires:  Prepare/Bind/Step/Finalize statements

<ol>
<li>Create the object using sqlite3_prepare_v2() </li>
<li>Bind values to host parameters using sqlite3_bind_ interfaces.</li>

<li>Reset the statement using sqlite3_reset() then go back to step 2 and repeat.</li>
<li>Destroy the statement object using sqlite3_finalize().</li>

<p>UPDATE I am guessing is slow compared to INSERT, but how does it compare to SELECT using the Primary key?</p>

"420843","<p>I'm having some trouble understanding the purpose of a salt to a password.  It's my understanding that the primary use is to hamper a rainbow table attack.  However, the methods I've seen to implement this don't seem to really make the problem harder.</p>

<p>I've seen many tutorials suggesting that the salt be used as the following:</p>

<pre><code>$hash =  md5($salt.$password)
</code></pre>

<p>The reasoning being that the hash now maps not to the original password, but a combination of the password and the salt.  But say <code>$salt=foo</code> and <code>$password=bar</code> and <code>$hash=3858f62230ac3c915f300c664312c63f</code>.  Now somebody with a rainbow table could reverse the hash and come up with the input ""foobar"".  They could then try all combinations of passwords (f, fo, foo, ... oobar, obar, bar, ar, ar).  It might take a few more milliseconds to get the password, but not much else.</p>

<p>The other use I've seen is on my linux system.  In the /etc/shadow the hashed passwords are actually stored <em>with</em> the salt.  For example, a salt of ""foo"" and password of ""bar"" would hash to this: <code>$1$foo$te5SBM.7C25fFDu6bIRbX1</code>.  If a hacker somehow were able to get his hands on this file, I don't see what purpose the salt serves, since the reverse hash of <code>te5SBM.7C25fFDu6bIRbX</code> is known to contain ""foo"".</p>

<p>Thanks for any light anybody can shed on this.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>:  Thanks for the help.  To summarize what I understand, the salt makes the hashed password more complex, thus making it much less likely to exist in a precomputed rainbow table.  What I misunderstood before was that I was assuming a rainbow table existed for ALL hashes.</p>

<p>The problem however is that I need the word ""FORMS"" when I ask for AuthenticationMethod.FORMS and not the id 1.</p>

<p>I have found the following solution for this problem (<a href=""http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/11130/String-Enumerations-in-C"" rel=""noreferrer"">link</a>):</p>

        _value = value;
    }

    public string Value
    {

    }

}
</code></pre>

<p>Then I can add this attribute to my enumerator:</p>

<pre><code>public enum AuthenticationMethod
{
    [StringValue(""FORMS"")]
    FORMS = 1,
    [StringValue(""WINDOWS"")]
    WINDOWSAUTHENTICATION = 2,
    [StringValue(""SSO"")]
    SINGLESIGNON = 3
}
</code></pre>

<p>And of course I need something to retrieve that StringValue:</p>

<pre><code>public static class StringEnum
{
    public static string GetStringValue(Enum value)
    {
        string output = null;
        Type type = value.GetType();

        //Check first in our cached results...

        //Look for our 'StringValueAttribute' 

        //in the field's custom attributes

        FieldInfo fi = type.GetField(value.ToString());
        StringValue[] attrs =
           fi.GetCustomAttributes(typeof(StringValue),
                                   false) as StringValue[];
        if (attrs.Length &gt; 0)
        {
            output = attrs[0].Value;
        }

        return output;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Good now I've got the tools to get a string value for an enumerator.
I can then use it like this:</p>

<pre><code>string valueOfAuthenticationMethod = StringEnum.GetStringValue(AuthenticationMethod.FORMS);
</code></pre>

<p>I mean, they probably have real-world data in some form, certainly including distances but also perhaps things like driving speeds, presence of sidewalks, train schedules, etc.  But suppose the data were in a simpler format, say a very large directed graph with edge weights reflecting distances.  I want to be able to quickly compute directions from one arbitrary point to another.  Sometimes these points will be close together (within one city) while sometimes they will be far apart (cross-country).</p>

<p>Graph algorithms like Dijkstra's algorithm will not work because the graph is enormous.  Luckily, heuristic algorithms like A* will probably work.  However, our data is very structured, and perhaps some kind of tiered approach might work?  (For example, store precomputed directions between certain ""key"" points far apart, as well as some local directions.  Then directions for two far-away points will involve local directions to a key points, global directions to another key point, and then local directions again.)</p>

<p>What algorithms are actually used in practice?</p>

<p>PS.  This question was motivated by finding quirks in online mapping directions.

<li>moving the query to a view, and selecting from the view is fast</li>
<li>selecting from the view from a stored procedure is 40x slower?</li>
</ul>

<p>I tried moving the definition of the view directly into the stored procedure (violating 3 business rules, and breaking an important encapsulation), and that makes it only about 6x slower.</p>

<p>Why is the stored procedure version so slow? What can possibly account for SQL Server running ad-hoc SQL faster than a different kind of ad-hoc SQL? </p>

<hr>

<p>My next attempt will be to have <code>StoredProcedureA</code> call <code>StoredProcedureB</code> call <code>StoredProcedureC</code> call <code>StoredProcedureD</code> to query the view.</p>

<p>And failing that, have the stored procedure call a stored procedure, call a UDF, call a UDF, call a stored procedure, call a UDF to query the view.</p>

<p>Some of the given reasons are:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/416183/in-java-critical-sections-what-should-i-synchronize-on#416198"">some <em>evil code</em> may steal your lock</a> (very popular this one, also has an ""accidentally"" variant)</li>
<li><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/309631/what-cases-require-synchronized-method-access-in-java#309677"">all synchronized methods within the same class use the exact same lock, which reduces throughput</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/439302/allowing-a-method-to-lock-its-parent-object-in-java#439317"">you are (unnecessarily) exposing too much information</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Other people, including me, argue that <code>synchronized(this)</code> is an idiom that is used a lot (also in Java libraries), is safe and well understood. It should not be avoided because you have a bug and you don't have a clue of what is going on in your multithreaded program. In other words: if it is applicable, then use it.</p>

<p>I am interested in seeing some real-world examples (no foobar stuff) where avoiding a lock on <code>this</code> is preferable when <code>synchronized(this)</code> would also do the job.</p>

<p>Therefore: <strong>should you always avoid <code>synchronized(this)</code> and replace it with a lock on a private reference?</strong>  </p>

<hr>

<p>Some further info (updated as answers are given):</p>

<ul>
<li>we are talking about instance synchronization</li>
<li>both implicit (<code>synchronized</code> methods) and explicit form of <code>synchronized(this)</code> are considered</li>
<li>if you quote Bloch or other authorities on the subject, don't leave out the parts you don't like (e.g. Effective Java, item on Thread Safety: <em>Typically it is the lock on the instance itself, but there are exceptions.)</em></li>
<li>if you need granularity in your locking other than <code>synchronized(this)</code> provides, then <code>synchronized(this)</code> is not applicable so that's not the issue</li>

<p>I've accepted an answer, but sadly, I believe we're stuck with our original worst case scenario: <strong>CAPTCHA everyone on purchase attempts of the crap</strong>. Short explanation: caching / web farms make it impossible to track hits, and any workaround (sending a non-cached web-beacon, writing to a unified table, etc.) slows the site down worse than the bots would. There is likely some pricey hardware from Cisco or the like that can help at a high level, but it's hard to justify the cost if CAPTCHA-ing everyone is an alternative. I'll attempt a more full explanation later, as well as cleaning this up for future searchers (though others are welcome to try, as it's community wiki).</p>

<h2>Situation</h2>
<p>This is about the bag o' crap sales on woot.com. I'm the president of Woot Workshop, the subsidiary of Woot that does the design, writes the product descriptions, podcasts, blog posts, and moderates the forums. I work with CSS/HTML and am only barely familiar with other technologies. I work closely with the developers and have talked through all of the answers here (and many other ideas we've had).</p>
<p>Usability is a massive part of my job, and making the site exciting and fun is most of the rest of it. That's where the three goals below derive. CAPTCHA harms usability, and bots steal the fun and excitement out of our crap sales.</p>
<p>Bots are slamming our front page tens of times a second screen scraping (and/or scanning our RSS) for the Random Crap sale. The moment they see that, it triggers a second stage of the program that logs in, clicks I want One, fills out the form, and buys the crap.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>On Woot, anonymous (non-logged) users can view our home page. In other words, the slamming bots can be non-authenticated (and essentially non-trackable except by IP address).</p>
<p>So we're back to scanning for IPs, which a) is fairly useless in this age of cloud networking and spambot zombies and b) catches too many innocents given the number of businesses that come from one IP address (not to mention the issues with non-static IP ISPs and potential performance hits to trying to track this).</p>

Our problem is bots are built specifically to defeat our site. Some of these methods could likely work for a short time until the scripters evolved their bots to ignore the honeypot, screen-scrape for nearby label names instead of form ids, and use a javascript-capable browser control.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The rest of the responses generally rely on IP tracking, which, again, seems to both be useless (with botnets/zombies/cloud networking) and detrimental (catching many innocents who come from same-IP destinations).</p>
<p>Any other approaches / ideas? My developers keep saying &quot;let's just do CAPTCHA&quot; but I'm hoping there's less intrusive methods to all actual humans wanting some of our crap.</p>
<h2>Original question</h2>
<p>Say you're selling something cheap that has a very high perceived value, and you have a very limited amount. No one knows exactly when you will sell this item. And over a million people regularly come by to see what you're selling.</p>
<p>You end up with scripters and bots attempting to programmatically [a] figure out when you're selling said item, and [b] make sure they're among the first to buy it. This sucks for two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Your site is slammed by non-humans, slowing everything down for everyone.</li>
<li>The scripters end up 'winning' the product, causing the regulars to feel cheated.</li>
</ol>
<p>A seemingly obvious solution is to create some hoops for your users to jump through before placing their order, but there are at least three problems with this:</p>
<ul>
<li>The user experience sucks for humans, as they have to decipher CAPTCHA, pick out the cat, or solve a math problem.</li>
<li>If the perceived benefit is high enough, and the crowd large enough, some group will find their way around any tweak, leading to an arms race. (This is especially true the simpler the tweak is; hidden 'comments' form, re-arranging the form elements, mis-labeling them, hidden 'gotcha' text all will work once and then need to be changed to fight targeting this specific form.)</li>
<li>Even if the scripters can't 'solve' your tweak it doesn't prevent them from slamming your front page, and then sounding an alarm for the scripter to fill out the order, manually. Given they get the advantage from solving [a], they will likely still win [b] since they'll be the first humans reaching the order page. Additionally, 1. still happens, causing server errors and a decreased performance for everyone.</li>
</ul>
<p>Another solution is to watch for IPs hitting too often, block them from the firewall, or otherwise prevent them from ordering. This could solve 2. and prevent [b] but the performance hit from scanning for IPs is massive and would likely cause more problems like 1. than the scripters were causing on their own. Additionally, the possibility of cloud networking and spambot zombies makes IP checking fairly useless.</p>
<p>A third idea, forcing the order form to be loaded for some time (say, half a second) would potentially slow the progress of the speedy orders, but again, the scripters would still be the first people in, at any speed not detrimental to actual users.</p>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<ol>
<li>Sell the item to non-scripting humans.</li>
<li>Keep the site running at a speed not slowed by bots.</li>
<li>Don't hassle the 'normal' users with any tasks to complete to prove they're human.</li>

"457927","<p>I've been using Git now for a couple of months on a project with one other developer. I have several years of experience with <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Subversion"" rel=""noreferrer"">SVN</a>, so I guess I bring a lot of baggage to the relationship.</p>

<p>I have heard that Git is excellent for branching and merging, and so far, I just don't see it. Sure, branching is dead simple, but when I try to merge, everything goes all to hell. Now, I'm used to that from SVN, but it seems to me that I just traded one sub-par versioning system for another.</p>

<p>My partner tells me that my problems stem from my desire to merge willy-nilly, and that I should be using rebase instead of merge in many situations. For example, here's the workflow that he's laid down:</p>

<pre><code>clone the remote repository
git checkout -b my_new_feature
..work and commit some stuff
git rebase master
..work and commit some stuff
git rebase master
..finish the feature
git checkout master
git merge my_new_feature
</code></pre>

<p>Essentially, create a feature branch, ALWAYS rebase from master to the branch, and merge from the branch back to master. Important to note is that the branch always stays local.</p>

<p>Here is the workflow that I started with</p>

<pre><code>clone remote repository
create my_new_feature branch on remote repository
git checkout -b --track my_new_feature origin/my_new_feature
..work, commit, push to origin/my_new_feature
git merge master (to get some changes that my partner added)
..work, commit, push to origin/my_new_feature
git merge master
..finish my_new_feature, push to origin/my_new_feature
git checkout master
git merge my_new_feature
delete remote branch
delete local branch
</code></pre>

<p>There are two essential differences (I think): I use merge always instead of rebasing, and I push my feature branch (and my feature branch commits) to the remote repository.</p>

<p>My reasoning for the remote branch is that I want my work backed up as I'm working. Our repository is automatically backed up and can be restored if something goes wrong. My laptop is not, or not as thoroughly. Therefore, I hate to have code on my laptop that's not mirrored somewhere else.</p>

<p>My reasoning for the merge instead of rebase is that merge seems to be standard and rebase seems to be an advanced feature. My gut feeling is that what I'm trying to do is not an advanced setup, so rebase should be unnecessary. I've even perused the new Pragmatic Programming book on Git, and they cover merge extensively and barely mention rebase.</p>

<p>Anyway, I was following my workflow on a recent branch, and when I tried to merge it back to master, it all went to hell. There were tons of conflicts with things that should have not mattered. The conflicts just made no sense to me. It took me a day to sort everything out, and eventually culminated in a forced push to the remote master, since my local master has all conflicts resolved, but the remote one still wasn't happy.</p>

<p>What is the ""correct"" workflow for something like this? Git is supposed to make branching and merging super-easy, and I'm just not seeing it.</p>

<p><strong>Update 2011-04-15</strong></p>

<p>This seems to be a very popular question, so I thought I'd update with my two years experience since I first asked.</p>

<p>It turns out that the original workflow is correct, at least in our case. In other words, this is what we do and it works:</p>

<pre><code>clone the remote repository
git checkout -b my_new_feature
..work and commit some stuff
git rebase master
..work and commit some stuff
git rebase master
..finish the feature, commit
git rebase master
git checkout master
git merge my_new_feature
</code></pre>

<p>In fact, our workflow is a little different, as we tend to do <em>squash merges</em> instead of raw merges. (<strong>Note: This is controversial, see below.</strong>) This allows us to turn our entire feature branch into a single commit on master. Then we delete our feature branch. This allows us to logically structure our commits on master, even if they're a little messy on our branches. So, this is what we do:</p>

<pre><code>clone the remote repository
git checkout -b my_new_feature
..work and commit some stuff
git rebase master
..work and commit some stuff
git rebase master
..finish the feature, commit
git rebase master
git checkout master
git merge --squash my_new_feature
git commit -m ""added my_new_feature""
git branch -D my_new_feature
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Squash Merge Controversy</strong> - As several commenters have pointed out, the squash merge will throw away all history on your feature branch. As the name implies, it squashes all the commits down into a single one. For small features, this makes sense as it condenses it down into a single package. For larger features, it's probably not a great idea, especially if your individual commits are already atomic. It really comes down to personal preference.</p>

<p><strong>Github and Bitbucket (others?) Pull Requests</strong> - In case you're wondering how merge/rebase relates to Pull Requests, I recommend following all the above steps up until you're ready to merge back to master. Instead of manually merging with git, you just accept the PR. Note that this will not do a squash merge (at least not by default), but non-squash, non-fast-forward is the accepted merge convention in the Pull Request community (as far as I know). Specifically, it works like this:</p>

<pre><code>clone the remote repository
git checkout -b my_new_feature
..work and commit some stuff
git rebase master
..work and commit some stuff
git rebase master
..finish the feature, commit
git rebase master
git push # May need to force push
...submit PR, wait for a review, make any changes requested for the PR
git rebase master
git push # Will probably need to force push (-f), due to previous rebases from master
...accept the PR, most likely also deleting the feature branch in the process
git checkout master
git branch -d my_new_feature
git remote prune origin
</code></pre>

<p>Background: I have a photo album website, and every image uploaded is renamed to an 8-hex-digit id (say, a58f375c.jpg).  This is to avoid filename conflicts (if lots of ""IMG0001.JPG"" files are uploaded, for example).  The original filename and any useful metadata is stored in a database.  Right now, I have somewhere around 1500 files in the images directory.  This makes listing the files in the directory (through FTP or SSH client) take a few seconds.  But I can't see that it has any effect other than that.  In particular, there doesn't seem to be any impact on how quickly an image file is served to the user.</p>

<p>I've thought about reducing the number of images by making 16 subdirectories: 0-9 and a-f.  Then I'd move the images into the subdirectories based on what the first hex digit of the filename was.

"477572","<p>I have a list view with a couple of image buttons on each row. When you click the list row, it launches a new activity. I have had to build my own tabs because of an issue with the camera layout. The activity that gets launched for the result is a map.

<p>The image preview on the list view is being done with the cursor and <code>ListAdapter</code>. This makes it pretty simple, but I am not sure how I can put a resized image (I.e. Smaller bit size not pixel as the <code>src</code> for the image button on the fly. So I just resized the image that came off the phone camera.</p>

"479233","<p>First, a little background: It is no secret that I am implementing an auth+auth system for CodeIgniter, and so far I'm winning (so to speak). But I've run into a pretty non-trivial challenge (one that most auth libraries miss entirely, but I insist on handling it properly): how to deal intelligently with <strong>large-scale, distributed, variable-username brute-force attacks</strong>.</p>

<p>I know all the usual tricks:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Limiting # of failed attempts per IP/host</strong> and denying the offenders access (e.g. Fail2Ban) - which no longer works <a href=""http://www.christopher-kunz.de/archives/205-Distributed-and-coordinated-SSH-bruteforce-attacks.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">since botnets have grown smarter</a></li>
<li>Combining the above with a <strong>blacklist of known 'bad' IPs/hosts</strong> (e.g. DenyHosts) - which relies on botnets falling for #1, <a href=""http://www.christopher-kunz.de/archives/205-Distributed-and-coordinated-SSH-bruteforce-attacks.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">which they increasingly don't</a></li>
<li><strong>IP/host whitelists</strong> combined with traditional auth (sadly useless with dynamic IP users and the high churn on most web sites)</li>
<li>Setting a <strong>sitewide limit</strong> on # of failed attempts within a N minute/hour period, and throttling (suspending) all login attempts after that for a number of minutes/hours (with the problem that DoS attacking you becomes botnet child's play)</li>
<li>Mandatory <strong>digital signatures</strong> (public-key certificates) or RSA hardware tokens for all users with NO login/password option (without question a rock-solid solution, but only practical for closed, dedicated services)</li>
<li>Enforced <strong>ultra-strong password schemes</strong> (e.g. >25 nonsense characters with symbols - again, too impractical for casual users)</li>
<li>And finally, <strong>CAPTCHAs</strong> (which could work in most cases, but are annoying for users and <a href=""http://caca.zoy.org/wiki/PWNtcha"" rel=""noreferrer"">virtually useless</a> against a <a href=""http://www.slideshare.net/valicac/captcha"" rel=""noreferrer"">determined, resourceful attacker</a>)</li>
</ol>

<p>Now, these are just the theoretically workable ideas. There are <em>plenty</em> of rubbish ideas that blow the site wide open (e.g. to trivial DoS attacks). What I want is something better. And by better, I mean:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>It has to be secure(+) against DoS and brute-force attacks, and not introduce any new vulnerabilities that might allow a slightly sneakier bot to continue operating under the radar</p></li>
<li><p>It has to be automated. If it requires a human operator to verify each login or monitor suspicious activity, it's not going to work in a real-world scenario</p></li>
<li><p>It has to be feasible for mainstream web use (ie. high churn, high volume, and open registration that can be performed by non-programmers)</p></li>
<li><p>It can't impede the user experience to the point where casual users will get annoyed or frustrated (and potentially abandon the site)</p></li>
<li><p>It can't involve kittens, unless they are <em>really really secure</em> kittens</p></li>
</ul>

<p>(+) <em>By 'secure', I mean at least as secure as a paranoid user's ability to keep his password secret</em></p>

<p>So - let's hear it! <em>How would you do it</em>? Do you know of a best-practice that I haven't mentioned (oh please say you do)? I admit I do have an idea of my own (combining ideas from 3 and 4), but I'll let the true experts speak before embarrassing myself ;-)</p>

<p>By ""proper"" I mean that if my parent element is <code>200px</code> tall and I specify <code>height = 100%</code> with <code>padding = 5px</code> I would expect that I should get a <code>190px</code> high element with <code>border = 5px</code> on all sides, nicely centered in the parent element.</p>

<p>Can anyone suggest others? How much improvement would caching on low-traffic sites?</p>

<p>Edit: Thanks for the tips so far. Any suggestions how to discover what's using up the memory? Are there any guides to Python memory profiling?</p>

<p>Also as mentioned there's a few things that will make it tricky to switch to mod_wsgi so I'd like to have some idea of the gains I could expect before ploughing forwards in that direction. </p>

<p><b>Edit:</b> <a href=""http://blog.dscpl.com.au/2009/03/load-spikes-and-excessive-memory-usage.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Graham Dumpleton's article</a> is the best I've found on the MPM and mod_wsgi related stuff. I am rather disappointed that no-one could provide any info on debugging the memory usage in the app itself though. </p>

<p><b>Final Edit:</b> Well I have been discussing this with Webfaction to see if they could assist with recompiling Apache and this is their word on the matter:</p>

<blockquote>""I really don't think that you will get much of a benefit by switching to an MPM Worker + mod_wsgi setup.  I estimate that you might be able to save around 20MB, but probably not much more than that.""</blockquote>

<p>So! This brings me back to my original question (which I am still none the wiser about). How does one go about identifying where the problems lies? It's a well known maxim that you don't optimize without testing to see where you need to optimize but there is very little in the way of tutorials on measuring Python memory usage and none at all specific to Django.</p>

I never encounter a problem where I think, ""Hmm...this looks like a job for a decorator!""</p>

"490420","<p>If you had to choose your <strong>Favorite</strong> (clever) techniques for defensive coding, what would they be?  Although my current languages are Java and Objective-C (with a background in C++), feel free to answer in any language.  Emphasis here would be on <em>clever</em> defensive techniques other than those that 70%+ of us here already know about.  So now it is time to dig deep into your bag of tricks.</p>

<p>In other words try to think of other than this <strong>uninteresting</strong> example:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>if(5 == x)</code> <strong>instead of</strong> <code>if(x == 5)</code>:  to avoid unintended assignment</li>
</ul>

<p>Here are some examples of some <strong>intriguing</strong> best defensive programming practices (language-specific examples are in Java):</p>

<p><strong>- Lock down your variables until you know that you need to change them</strong></p>

<p>That is, you can declare <em>all</em> variables <code>final</code> until you know that you will need to change it, at which point you can remove the <code>final</code>. One commonly unknown fact is that this is also valid for method params:</p>

<pre><code>public void foo(final int arg) { /* Stuff Here */ }
</code></pre>

<p><strong>- When something bad happens, leave a trail of evidence behind</strong></p>

<p>There are a number of things you can do when you have an exception: obviously logging it and performing some cleanup would be a few.  But you can also leave a trail of evidence (e.g. setting variables to sentinel values like ""UNABLE TO LOAD FILE"" or 99999 would be useful in the debugger, in case you happen to blow past an exception <code>catch</code>-block).</p>

<p><strong>- When it comes to consistency: the devil is in the details</strong></p>

<p>Be as consistent with the other libraries that you are using.  For example, in Java, if you are creating a method that extracts a range of values make the lower bound <em>inclusive</em> and the upper bound <em>exclusive</em>.  This will make it consistent with methods like <code>String.substring(start, end)</code> which operates in the same way.  You'll find all of these type of methods in the Sun JDK to behave this way as it makes various operations including iteration of elements consistent with arrays, where the indices are from Zero (<em>inclusive</em>) to the length of the array (<em>exclusive</em>). </p>

This question is similar but not quite the same <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/454868/handling-dialogs-in-wpf-with-mvvm"">as this one (handling-dialogs-in-wpf-with-mvvm)</a>...</p>
<p>I have a &quot;Login&quot; form written using the MVVM pattern.</p>
<p>This form has a ViewModel which holds the Username and Password, which are bound to the view in the XAML using normal data bindings.
It also has a &quot;Login&quot; command which is bound to the &quot;Login&quot; button on the form, agan using normal databinding.</p>
<p>When the &quot;Login&quot; command fires, it invokes a function in the ViewModel which goes off and sends data over the network to log in. When this function completes, there are 2 actions:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The login was invalid - we just show a MessageBox and all is fine</p>
</li>
<li><p>The login was valid, we need to close the Login form and have it return true as its <code>DialogResult</code>...</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The problem is, the ViewModel knows nothing about the actual view, so how can it close the view and tell it to return a particular DialogResult?? I could stick some code in the CodeBehind, and/or pass the View through to the ViewModel, but that seems like it would defeat the whole point of MVVM entirely...</p>
<hr />
<h3>Update</h3>
<p>In the end I just violated the &quot;purity&quot; of the MVVM pattern and had the View publish a <code>Closed</code> event, and expose a <code>Close</code> method. The ViewModel would then just call <code>view.Close</code>. The view is only known via an interface and wired up via an IOC container, so no testability or maintainability is lost.</p>
<p>It seems rather silly that the accepted answer is at -5 votes! While I'm well aware of the good feelings that one gets by solving a problem while being &quot;pure&quot;, Surely I'm not the only one that thinks that 200 lines of events, commands and behaviors just to avoid a one line method in the name of &quot;patterns&quot; and &quot;purity&quot; is a bit ridiculous....</p>

<p>Problem was elsewhere when you tried to use the hash you'd get warnings:</p>

<p>To me, ""unmanaged"" means things like database connections, sockets, window handles, etc.  But, I've seen code where the <code>Dispose()</code> method is implemented to free <em>managed</em> resources, which seems redundant to me, since the garbage collector should take care of that for you.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>public class MyCollection : IDisposable
{
    private List&lt;String&gt; _theList = new List&lt;String&gt;();
    private Dictionary&lt;String, Point&gt; _theDict = new Dictionary&lt;String, Point&gt;();

        _theDict.clear();
        _theList = null;
        _theDict = null;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>My question is, does this make the garbage collector free memory used by <code>MyCollection</code> any faster than it normally would?</p>

<p><strong>edit</strong>:  So far people have posted some good examples of using IDisposable to clean up unmanaged resources such as database connections and bitmaps.  But suppose that <code>_theList</code> in the above code contained a million strings, and you wanted to free that memory <em>now</em>, rather than waiting for the garbage collector.

The answer apparently is not simple due to memory managment issues. <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/134575/using-interface-builder-for-uitableviews"">This thread</a> mentions the issue and suggests a solution, but is pre NDA-release and lacks code. Here's a <a href=""http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?messageID=8040526&amp;tstart=0"" rel=""noreferrer"">long thread</a> that discusses the issue without providing a definitive answer. </p>

<pre><code>static NSString *CellIdentifier = @""MyCellIdentifier"";

MyCell *cell = (MyCell *)[tableView dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifier:CellIdentifier];
if (cell == nil) {
    NSArray *nib = [[NSBundle mainBundle] loadNibNamed:CellIdentifier owner:self options:nil];
    cell = (MyCell *)[nib objectAtIndex:0];
}
</code></pre>

<p>To use this code, create MyCell.m/.h, a new subclass of <code>UITableViewCell</code> and add <code>IBOutlets</code> for the components you want. Then create a new ""Empty XIB"" file. Open the Xib file in IB, add a <code>UITableViewCell</code> object, set its identifier to ""MyCellIdentifier"", and set its class to MyCell and add your components. Finally, connect the <code>IBOutlets</code> to the components. Note that we did not set the File's Owner in IB.</p>

<p>Other methods advocate setting the File's Owner and warn of memory leaks if the Xib is not loaded via an additional factory class. I tested the above under Instruments/Leaks and saw no memory leaks. </p>

<p>So what's the canonical way to load cells from Xibs? Do we set File's Owner? Do we need a factory? If so, what's the code for the factory look like? If there are multiple solutions, let's clarify the pros and cons of each of them...</p>

These two things together mean that you'll have lots of interfaces with a single POJO implementation.</p>

<p>So, I guess my question boils down to: <strong>""Is it worth following the broader Interface naming convention especially in light of where Java Frameworks seem to be heading?""</strong></p>

<li>Google JSAPI</li>
<li>jQuery's site</li>
<li>your own site/server</li>
<li>another CDN</li>
</ul>

<p>I have recently been using Google JSAPI, but have found that it takes a long time to setup an SSL connection or even only to resolve google.com. I have been using the following for Google:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script src=""https://www.google.com/jsapi""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
google.load('jquery', '1.3.1');
&lt;/script&gt;

<p>I like the idea of using Google so it's cached when visiting other sites and to save bandwidth from our server, but if it keeps being the slow portion of the site, I may change the include.</p>

<p>What do you use? Have you had any issues?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Just visited jQuery's site and they use the following method:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type=""text/javascript"" src=""http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.3/jquery.min.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

<p><strong>Edit2:</strong> Here's how I've been including jQuery without any problems for the last year:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script src=""//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.4.3/jquery.min.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

<p>One of the resources I'm using is Stanford's CS193P class notes that they have left on the web.  It includes lecture notes, assignments and sample code, and since the course was given by Apple dev's, I definitely consider it to be ""from the horse's mouth"".</p>

<p>Lecture 08 is related to an assignment to build a UINavigationController based app that has multiple UIViewControllers pushed onto the UINavigationController stack.  That's how the UINavigationController works.  That's logical.  However, there are some stern warnings in the slide about communicating between your UIViewControllers.</p>

<p>I'm going to quote from this serious of slides:<br>
<a href=""http://cs193p.stanford.edu/downloads/08-NavigationTabBarControllers.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://cs193p.stanford.edu/downloads/08-NavigationTabBarControllers.pdf</a></p>

  <li>Direct dependencies make your code less reusable
  
  <ul>
  <li>And more difficult to debug &amp; test</li>
  </ul></li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Ok.  I'm down with that.  Don't blindly toss all your methods that will be used for communicating between the viewcontroller into your app delegate and reference the viewcontroller instances in the app delegate methods.  Fair 'nuff.</p>

<p>A bit further on, we get this slide telling us what we <em>should</em> do.</p>

<p>Page 18/51:</p>

<blockquote>
  <h1>Best Practices for Data Flow</h1>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Figure out <strong>exactly</strong> what needs to be communicated</li>
  <li><strong>Define input parameters</strong> for your view controller</li>
  <li>For communicating back up the hierarchy, <strong>use loose coupling</strong>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Define a generic interface for observers (like delegation)</li>
  </ul></li>

<p>Ok, so... I'm afraid my objc-fu is not so strong.  I'm also a bit confused by the final line in the above quote.  I've been doing my fair share of googling about this and I found what appears to be a decent article talking about the various methods of Observing/Notification techniques:<br>

<p>Method #5 even indicates delegates as an method!  Except.... objects can only set one delegate at a time.  So when I have multiple viewcontroller communication, what am I to do?</p>

<p>Ok, that's the set up gang.  I know I can easily do my communication methods in the app delegate by reference's the multiple viewcontroller instances in my appdelegate but I want to do this sort of thing the <em>right</em> way.</p>

<p>Please help me ""do the right thing"" by answering the following questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>When I am trying to push a new viewcontroller on the UINavigationController stack, <strong>who</strong> should be doing this push.  <strong>Which</strong> class/file in my code is the correct place?</li>
<li>When I want to affect some piece of data (value of an iVar) in one of my UIViewControllers when I am in a <strong>different</strong> UIViewController, what is the ""right"" way to do this?</li>
<li>Give that we can only have one delegate set at a time in an object, what would the implementation look like for when the lecturer says <em>""Define a generic interface for observers (like delegation)""</em>.  A pseudocode example would be awfully helpful here if possible.</li>

"573294","<p>I am little confused with the applicability of <code>reinterpret_cast</code> vs <code>static_cast</code>. From what I have read the general rules are to use static cast when the types can be interpreted at compile time hence the word <code>static</code>. This is the cast the C++ compiler uses internally for implicit casts also.</p>

<p><code>reinterpret_cast</code>s are applicable in two scenarios:</p>

<ul>
<li>convert integer types to pointer types and vice versa </li>
<li>convert one pointer type to another. The general idea I get is this is unportable and should be avoided.  </li>
</ul>

<p>Where I am a little confused is one usage which I need, I am calling C++ from C and the C code needs to hold on to the C++ object so basically it holds a <code>void*</code>. What cast should be used to convert between the <code>void *</code> and the Class type?</p>

<p>I have seen usage of both <code>static_cast</code> and <code>reinterpret_cast</code>? Though from what I have been reading it appears <code>static</code> is better as the cast can happen at compile time?

"573872","<p>I like instantiating my WCF service clients within a <code>using</code> block as it's pretty much the standard way to use resources that implement <code>IDisposable</code>:</p>

<pre><code>using (var client = new SomeWCFServiceClient()) 
{
    //Do something with the client 
}
</code></pre>

<p>But, as noted in <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa355056.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">this MSDN article</a>, wrapping a WCF client in a <code>using</code> block could mask any errors that result in the client being left in a faulted state (like a timeout or communication problem). Long story short, when Dispose() is called, the client's Close() method fires, but throws an error because it's in a faulted state. The original exception is then masked by the second exception. Not good.</p>

<p>The suggested workaround in the MSDN article is to completely avoid using a <code>using</code> block, and to instead instantiate your clients and use them something like this:</p>

<pre><code>try
{
    ...
    client.Close();
}
catch (CommunicationException e)
{
    ...
    client.Abort();
}
catch (TimeoutException e)
{
    ...
    client.Abort();
}
catch (Exception e)
{
    ...
    client.Abort();
    throw;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Compared to the <code>using</code> block, I think that's ugly. And a lot of code to write each time you need a client.</p>

<p>Luckily, I found a few other workarounds, such as this one on IServiceOriented. You start with:</p>

<pre><code>public delegate void UseServiceDelegate&lt;T&gt;(T proxy); 

public static class Service&lt;T&gt; 
{ 
    public static ChannelFactory&lt;T&gt; _channelFactory = new ChannelFactory&lt;T&gt;(""""); 

    public static void Use(UseServiceDelegate&lt;T&gt; codeBlock) 
    { 
        IClientChannel proxy = (IClientChannel)_channelFactory.CreateChannel(); 
        bool success = false; 
        try 
        { 
            codeBlock((T)proxy); 
            proxy.Close(); 
            success = true; 
        } 
        finally 
        { 
            if (!success) 
            { 
                proxy.Abort(); 
            } 
        } 
     } 
} 
</code></pre>

<p>Which then allows:</p>

<pre><code>Service&lt;IOrderService&gt;.Use(orderService =&gt; 
{ 
    orderService.PlaceOrder(request); 
}); 
</code></pre>

<p>That's not bad, but I don't think it's as expressive and easily understandable as the <code>using</code> block.</p>

<p>The workaround I'm currently trying to use I first read about on <a href=""http://blog.davidbarrett.net/archive/2007/11.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">blog.davidbarret.net</a>. Basically you override the client's <code>Dispose()</code> method wherever you use it. Something like:</p>

<pre><code>public partial class SomeWCFServiceClient : IDisposable
{
    void IDisposable.Dispose() 
    {
        if (this.State == CommunicationState.Faulted) 
        {
            this.Abort();
        } 
        else 
        {
            this.Close();
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This appears to be able to allow the <code>using</code> block again without the danger of masking a faulted state exception. </p>

<p>So, are there any other gotchas I have to look out for using these workarounds? Has anybody come up with anything better?</p>

"577554","<p>One of the stated reasons for knowing assembler is that, on occasion, it can be employed to write code that will be more performant than writing that code in a higher-level language, C in particular.  However, I've also heard it stated many times that although that's not entirely false, the cases where assembler can <strong>actually</strong> be used to generate more performant code are both extremely rare and require expert knowledge of and experience with assembly.  </p>

<p>This question doesn't even get into the fact that assembler instructions will be machine-specific and non-portable, or any of the other aspects of assembler.  There are plenty of good reasons for knowing assembly besides this one, of course, but this is meant to be a specific question soliciting examples and data, not an extended discourse on assembler versus higher-level languages.</p>

<p>Can anyone provide some <strong>specific examples</strong> of cases where assembly will be faster than well-written C code using a modern compiler, and can you support that claim with profiling evidence?

"599308","<p>I've been programming for a while but It's been mostly Java and C#. I've never actually had to manage memory on my own. I recently began programming in C++ and I'm a little confused as to when I should store things on the stack and when to store them on the heap.</p>

<p>My understanding is that variables which are accessed very frequently should be stored on the stack and objects, rarely used variables, and large data structures should all be stored on the heap. Is this correct or am I incorrect?</p>

"599365","<p>For example, I recently came across this in the linux kernel:</p>

<pre>
/* Force a compilation error if condition is true */
#define BUILD_BUG_ON(condition) ((void)sizeof(char[1 - 2*!!(condition)]))
</pre>

<p>So, in your code, if you have some structure which must be, say a multiple of 8 bytes in size, maybe because of some hardware constraints, you can do:</p>

<pre>
BUILD_BUG_ON((sizeof(struct mystruct) % 8) != 0);
</pre>

<p>and it won't compile unless the size of struct mystruct is a multiple of 8, and if it is a multiple of 8, no runtime code is generated at all.</p>

<p>Another trick I know is from the book ""Graphics Gems"" which allows a single header file to both declare and initialize variables in one module while in other modules using that module, merely declare them as externs.</p>

<pre>
#ifdef DEFINE_MYHEADER_GLOBALS
#define GLOBAL
#define INIT(x, y) (x) = (y)
#else
#define GLOBAL extern
#define INIT(x, y)
#endif

GLOBAL int INIT(x, 0);
GLOBAL int somefunc(int a, int b);
</pre>

<p>With that, the code which defines x and somefunc does:</p>

<pre>
#define DEFINE_MYHEADER_GLOBALS
#include ""the_above_header_file.h""
</pre>

<p>while code that's merely using x and somefunc() does:</p>

<pre>
#include ""the_above_header_file.h""
</pre>

<p>So you get one header file that declares both instances of globals and function prototypes where they are needed, and the corresponding extern declarations.</p>

"600293","<p>Today I needed a simple algorithm for checking if a number is a power of 2.</p>

<p>The algorithm needs to be:</p>

<ol>
<li>Simple</li>
<li>Correct for any <code>ulong</code> value.</li>
</ol>

<p>I came up with this simple algorithm:</p>

<pre><code>private bool IsPowerOfTwo(ulong number)
{
    if (number == 0)
        return false;

    for (ulong power = 1; power &gt; 0; power = power &lt;&lt; 1)
    {
        // This for loop used shifting for powers of 2, meaning
        // that the value will become 0 after the last shift
        // (from binary 1000...0000 to 0000...0000) then, the 'for'
        // loop will break out.

        if (power == number)
            return true;
        if (power &gt; number)
            return false;
    }
    return false;
}
</code></pre>

<p>But then I thought, how about checking if <code>log<sub>2</sub> x</code> is an exactly round number? But when I checked for 2^63+1, <code>Math.Log</code> returned exactly 63 because of rounding. So I checked if 2 to the power 63 is equal to the original number - and it is, because the calculation is done in <code>double</code>s and not in exact numbers:</p>

<pre><code>private bool IsPowerOfTwo_2(ulong number)
{
    double log = Math.Log(number, 2);
    double pow = Math.Pow(2, Math.Round(log));
    return pow == number;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This returned <code>true</code> for the given wrong value: <code>9223372036854775809</code>.</p>

I also know that I should be able to add <code>template</code> somewhere to tell the compiler that inUnion is a template-id. But where exactly? And should it then assume that inUnion is a class template, i.e. <code>inUnion&lt;U&gt;</code> names a type and not a function?</p>

"611906","<p>I'm designing an API to go over HTTP and I am wondering if using the HTTP POST command, but with URL query parameters only and no request body, is a good way to go.</p>
<p>Considerations:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Good Web design&quot; requires non-idempotent actions to be sent via POST. This is a non-idempotent action.</li>
<li>It is easier to develop and debug this app when the request parameters are present in the URL.</li>
<li>The API is not intended for widespread use.</li>
<li>It seems like making a POST request with no body will take a bit more work, e.g. a <code>Content-Length: 0</code> header must be explicitly added.</li>
<li>It also seems to me that a POST with no body is a bit counter to most developer's and HTTP frameworks' expectations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Are there any more pitfalls or advantages to sending parameters on a POST request via the URL query rather than the request body?</p>
<p>Edit: The reason this is under consideration is that the operations are not idempotent and have side effects other than retrieval. See <a href=""http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">the HTTP spec</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In particular, the convention has been
established that the GET and HEAD
methods SHOULD NOT have the
significance of taking an action other
than retrieval. These methods ought to
be considered &quot;safe&quot;. This allows user
agents to represent other methods,
such as POST, PUT and DELETE, in a
special way, so that the user is made
aware of the fact that a possibly
unsafe action is being requested.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Methods can also have the property of
&quot;idempotence&quot; in that (aside from
error or expiration issues) the
side-effects of N &gt; 0 identical
requests is the same as for a single
request. The methods GET, HEAD, PUT
and DELETE share this property. Also,
the methods OPTIONS and TRACE SHOULD
NOT have side effects, and so are
inherently idempotent.</p>

"613954","<p>For a number of years now I have been unable to get a decent answer to the following question: why are some developers so against checked exceptions?  I have had numerous conversations, read things on blogs, read what Bruce Eckel had to say (the first person I saw speak out against them).</p>
<p>I am currently writing some new code and paying very careful attention to how I deal with exceptions.  I am trying to see the point of view of the &quot;we don't like checked exceptions&quot; crowd and I still cannot see it.</p>
<p>Every conversation I have ends with the same question going unanswered... let me set it up:</p>
<p>In general (from how Java was designed),</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Error</code> is for things that should never be caught (VM has a peanut allergy and someone dropped a jar of peanuts on it)</li>
<li><code>RuntimeException</code> is for things that the programmer did wrong (programmer walked off the end of an array)</li>
<li><code>Exception</code> (except <code>RuntimeException</code>) is for things that are out of the programmer's control (disk fills up while writing to the file system, file handle limit for the process has been reached and you cannot open any more files)</li>
<li><code>Throwable</code> is simply the parent of all of the exception types.</li>
</ul>
<p>A common argument I hear is that if an exception happens then all the developer is going to do is exit the program.</p>
<p>Another common argument I hear is that checked exceptions make it harder to refactor code.</p>
<p>For the &quot;all I am going to do is exit&quot; argument I say that even if you are exiting you need to display a reasonable error message.  If you are just punting on handling errors then your users won't be overly happy when the program exits without a clear indication of why.</p>
<p>For the &quot;it makes it hard to refactor&quot; crowd, that indicates that the proper level of abstraction wasn't chosen.  Rather than declare a method throws an <code>IOException</code>, the <code>IOException</code> should be transformed into an exception that is more suited for what is going on.</p>
<p>I don't have an issue with wrapping Main with <code>catch(Exception)</code> (or in some cases <code>catch(Throwable)</code> to ensure that the program can exit gracefully - but I always catch the specific exceptions I need to.  Doing that allows me to, at the very least, display an appropriate error message.</p>
<p>The question that people never reply to is this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you throw <code>RuntimeException</code>
subclasses instead of <code>Exception</code>
subclasses then how do you know what
you are supposed to catch?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the answer is catch <code>Exception</code> then you are also dealing with programmer errors the same way as system exceptions.  That seems wrong to me.</p>
<p>If you catch <code>Throwable</code> then you are treating system exceptions and VM errors (and the like) the same way.  That seems wrong to me.</p>
<p>If the answer is that you catch only the exceptions you know are thrown then how do you know what ones are thrown?  What happens when programmer X throws a new exception and forgot to catch it?  That seems very dangerous to me.</p>
<p>I would say that a program that displays a stack trace is wrong.  Do people who don't like checked exceptions not feel that way?</p>
<p>So, if you don't like checked exceptions can you explain why not AND answer the question that doesn't get answered please?</p>
<p>I am not looking for advice on when to use either model, what I am looking for is <em>why</em> people extend from <code>RuntimeException</code> because they don't like extending from <code>Exception</code> and/or why they catch an exception and then rethrow a <code>RuntimeException</code> rather than add throws to their method.  I want to understand the motivation for disliking checked exceptions.</p>

Trouble is, we don't have a whole lot of budget here, so I have to justify the expense to the powers that be.  So I want to know:</p>

<p>
<li> What kind of tools/licenses will I need?  Right now, we use Visual Studio and Smart Assembly to build, and Perforce for source control.  Will I need something else, or is there an equivalent of a cron job for running automated scripts?
<li> What, exactly, will this get me, other than an indication of a broken build?  Should I set up test projects in this solution (sln file) that will be run by these scripts, so I can have particular functions tested?  We have, at the moment, two such tests, because we haven't had the time (or frankly, the experience) to make good unit tests.
<li> What kind of hardware will I need for this?
<li> Once a build has been finished and tested, is it a common practice to put that build up on an ftp site or have some other way for internal access?  The idea is that this machine makes <em>the</em> build, and we all go to it, but can make debug builds if we have to.<br>
<li> How often should we make this kind of build?
<li> How is space managed?  If we make nightly builds, should we keep around all the old builds, or start to ditch them after about a week or so?
<li> Is there anything else I'm not seeing here?

"635483","<p>I have a data structure which essentially amounts to a nested dictionary. Let's say it looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>{'new jersey': {'mercer county': {'plumbers': 3,
                                  'programmers': 81},
                'middlesex county': {'programmers': 81,
                                     'salesmen': 62}},
 'new york': {'queens county': {'plumbers': 9,
                                'salesmen': 36}}}
</code></pre>

<p>Now, maintaining and creating this is pretty painful; every time I have a new state/county/profession I have to create the lower layer dictionaries via obnoxious try/catch blocks. Moreover, I have to create annoying nested iterators if I want to go over all the values. </p>

<p>I could also use tuples as keys, like such:</p>

<pre><code>{('new jersey', 'mercer county', 'plumbers'): 3,
 ('new jersey', 'mercer county', 'programmers'): 81,
 ('new jersey', 'middlesex county', 'programmers'): 81,
 ('new jersey', 'middlesex county', 'salesmen'): 62,
 ('new york', 'queens county', 'plumbers'): 9,
 ('new york', 'queens county', 'salesmen'): 36}
</code></pre>

<p>This makes iterating over the values very simple and natural, but it is more syntactically painful to do things like aggregations and looking at subsets of the dictionary (e.g. if I just want to go state-by-state).</p>

<p>Basically, sometimes I want to think of a nested dictionary as a flat dictionary, and sometimes I want to think of it indeed as a complex hierarchy. I could wrap this all in a class, but it seems like someone might have done this already. Alternatively, it seems like there might be some really elegant syntactical constructions to do this. </p>

<p>What's the real result here?  My thinking is that the process dies and then the heap space is gone anyway so there's no harm in missing the call to <code>free</code> (however, I do recognize the importance of having it anyway for closure, maintainability, and good practice).  Am I right in this thinking?</p>

<p>Second, let's say I have a program that acts a bit like a shell.  Users can declare variables like <code>aaa = 123</code> and those are stored in some dynamic data structure for later use.  Clearly, it seems obvious that you'd use some solution that will calls some *alloc function (hashmap, linked list, something like that).  For this kind of program, it doesn't make sense to ever free after calling <code>malloc</code> because these variables must be present at all times during the program's execution and there's no good way (that I can see) to implement this with statically allocated space.  Is it bad design to have a bunch of memory that's allocated but only freed as part of the process ending?  If so, what's the alternative?</p>

"655065","<p>I've been using C++ for a short while, and I've been wondering about the <em>new</em> keyword. Simply, should I be using it, or not?</p>

<p>1) With the <em>new</em> keyword...</p>

<pre><code>MyClass* myClass = new MyClass();
myClass-&gt;MyField = ""Hello world!"";
</code></pre>

<p>2) Without the <em>new</em> keyword...</p>

<pre><code>MyClass myClass;
myClass.MyField = ""Hello world!"";
</code></pre>

<p>From an implementation perspective, they don't seem that different (but I'm sure they are)... However, my primary language is C#, and of course the 1st method is what I'm used to.</p>

<p>The difficulty seems to be that method 1 is harder to use with the std C++ classes.</p>

<p>Which method should I use?</p>

<h3>Update 1:</h3>

<p>I recently used the <em>new</em> keyword for <em>heap</em> memory (or <em>free store</em>) for a large array which was going out of scope (i.e. being returned from a function). Where before I was using the stack, which caused half of the elements to be corrupt outside of scope, switching to heap usage ensured that the elements were in tact. Yay!</p>

<h3>Update 2:</h3>

<p>A friend of mine recently told me there's a simple rule for using the <code>new</code> keyword; every time you type <code>new</code>, type <code>delete</code>.</p>

<pre><code>Foobar *foobar = new Foobar();
delete foobar; // TODO: Move this to the right place.
</code></pre>

<p>This helps to prevent memory leaks, as you always have to put the delete somewhere (i.e. when you cut and paste it to either a destructor or otherwise).</p>

<p>I understand the distinction between <strong><code>+T</code></strong> and <strong><code>T</code></strong> in the type declaration (it compiles if I use <strong><code>T</code></strong>).

"664205","<p>From <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/526641/what-to-put-in-your-viewmodel"">this question</a>, it looks like it makes sense to have a controller create a <strong>ViewModel</strong> that more accurately reflects the model that the view is trying to display, but I'm curious about some of the conventions (I'm new to the MVC pattern, if it wasn't already obvious).</p>

<p>Basically, I had the following questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>I normally like to have one class/file.  Does this make sense with a <strong>ViewModel</strong> if it is only being created to hand off data from a controller to a view?</li>
<li>If a <strong>ViewModel</strong> does belong in its own file, and you're using a directory/project structure to keep things separate, where does the <strong>ViewModel</strong> file belong?  In the <strong>Controllers</strong> directory?</li>
</ol>

<p>That's basically it for now.  I might have a few more questions coming up, but this has been bothering me for the last hour or so, and I can seem to find consistent guidance elsewhere.</p>

<p>On a website, it's common practice to create a logo that links to the homepage. I want to do the same, while best optimizing for search engines, screen readers, IE 6+, and browsers who have disabled CSS and/or images.</p>

<p><strong>Example One:</strong> Doesn't use an h1 tag. Not as good for SEO, right?</p>

        &lt;img src=""logo.png"" alt=""Stack Overflow"" /&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<p><strong>Example Two:</strong> Found this somewhere. The CSS seems a little hacky.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;h1 id=""logo""&gt;
    &lt;a href=""""&gt;Stack Overflow&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
</code></pre>

<pre class=""lang-css prettyprint-override""><code>/* css */
#logo {
    padding: 70px 0 0 0;
    overflow: hidden;
    background-image: url(""logo.png"");
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    height: 0px !important;
    height /**/:70px;
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Example Three:</strong> Same HTML, different approach using text-indent. This is the ""Phark"" approach to image replacement.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;h1 id=""logo""&gt;
    &lt;a href=""""&gt;Stack Overflow&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;

<p>proposes a 1-line method to timeout a long-running command from the bash command line:</p>
<pre><code>( /path/to/slow command with options ) &amp; sleep 5 ; kill $!
</code></pre>
<p>But it's possible that a given &quot;long-running&quot; command may finish earlier than the timeout.<br />
(Let's call it a &quot;typically-long-running-but-sometimes-fast&quot; command, or <em>tlrbsf</em> for fun.)</p>
<p>So this nifty 1-liner approach has a couple of problems.<br />
First, the <code>sleep</code> isn't conditional, so that sets an undesirable lower bound on the time taken for the sequence to finish. Consider 30s or 2m or even 5m for the sleep, when the <em>tlrbsf</em> command finishes in 2 seconds — highly undesirable.<br />
Second, the <code>kill</code> is unconditional, so this sequence will attempt to kill a non-running process and whine about it.</p>
<p>So...</p>
<p><strong>Is there a way</strong> to timeout a typically-long-running-but-sometimes-fast (<em>&quot;tlrbsf&quot;</em>) command that</p>
<ul>
<li>has a bash implementation (the other question already has Perl and C answers)</li>
<li>will terminate at the earlier of the two: <em>tlrbsf</em> program termination, or timeout elapsed</li>
<li>will not kill non-existing/non-running processes (or, optionally: will not <em>complain</em> about a bad kill)</li>
<li>doesn't have to be a 1-liner</li>
<li>can run under Cygwin or Linux</li>
</ul>
<p>... and, for bonus points</p>
<ul>
<li>runs the <em>tlrbsf</em> command in the foreground</li>
<li>any 'sleep' or extra process in the background</li>
</ul>
<p>such that the stdin/stdout/stderr of the <em>tlrbsf</em> command can be redirected, same as if it had been run directly?</p>
<p>If so, please share your code. If not, please explain why.</p>

<p>People often want to match starting tags to ending tags, but XML and HTML allow tags to contain themselves (which traditional regexes cannot handle at all):</p>

<pre><code>&lt;span id=""outer""&gt;&lt;span id=""inner""&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p>People often want to match against the content of a document (such as the famous ""find all phone numbers on a given page"" problem), but the data may be marked up (even if it appears to be normal when viewed):</p>

"742013","<p>I want to create a URL shortener service where you can write a long URL into an input field and the service shortens the URL to ""<code>http://www.example.org/abcdef</code>"".</p>

<p>Instead of ""<code>abcdef</code>"" there can be any other string with six characters containing <code>a-z, A-Z and 0-9</code>. That makes 56~57 billion possible strings.</p>

<p>My approach:</p>

<p>I have a database table with three columns:</p>

<ol>
<li>id, integer, auto-increment</li>
<li>long, string, the long URL the user entered</li>
<li>short, string, the shortened URL (or just the six characters)</li>
</ol>

<p>I would then insert the long URL into the table. Then I would select the auto-increment value for ""<code>id</code>"" and build a hash of it. This hash should then be inserted as ""<code>short</code>"". But what sort of hash should I build? Hash algorithms like MD5 create too long strings. I don't use these algorithms, I think. A self-built algorithm will work, too.</p>

<p>My idea:</p>

<p>For ""<code>http://www.google.de/</code>"" I get the auto-increment id <code>239472</code>. Then I do the following steps:</p>

<pre><code>short = '';
if divisible by 2, add ""a""+the result to short
if divisible by 3, add ""b""+the result to short
... until I have divisors for a-z and A-Z.
</code></pre>

<p>That could be repeated until the number isn't divisible any more. Do you think this is a good approach? Do you have a better idea?</p>

"746047","<p>I hope that in this post, I can get people's opinions on best practices for the interface between JSF pages and backing beans.</p>

<p>One thing that I never can settle on is the structure of my backing beans. Furthermore, I have never found a good article on the subject.</p>

<p>What properties belong on which backing beans? When is it appropriate to add more properties to a given bean as opposed to creating a new bean and adding the properties onto it? For simple applications, does it make sense to just have a single backing bean for the whole page, considering the complexity involved with injecting one bean into another? Should the backing bean contain any actual business logic, or should it strictly contain data? </p>

<p>Feel free to answer these questions and any others that may come up.</p>

<hr />

<p>As for reducing coupling between the JSF page and the backing bean, I never allow the JSF page to access any backing bean property's properties. For example, I never allow something such as:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;h:outputText value=""#{myBean.anObject.anObjectProperty}"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I always require something like:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;h:outputText value=""#{myBean.theObjectProperty}"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>with a backing bean value of:</p>

<pre><code>public String getTheObjectProperty()
{
    return anObject.getAnObjectProperty();
}
</code></pre>

<p>When I loop over a collection, I use a wrapper class to avoid drilling down into an object in a data table, for instance. </p>

<p>In general, this approach feels ""right"" to me. It avoids any coupling between the view and the data. Please correct me if I'm wrong.</p>

"746082","<p>Lately I have been playing a game on my iPhone called Scramble. Some of you may know this game as Boggle. Essentially, when the game starts you get a matrix of letters like so:</p>

<pre><code>F X I E
A M L O
E W B X
A S T U
</code></pre>

<p>The goal of the game is to find as many words as you can that can be formed by chaining letters together. You can start with any letter, and all the letters that surround it are fair game, and then once you move on to the next letter, all the letters that surround that letter are fair game, <strong>except for any previously used letters</strong>. So in the grid above, for example, I could come up with the words <code>LOB</code>, <code>TUX</code>, <code>SEA</code>, <code>FAME</code>, etc. Words must be at least 3 characters, and no more than NxN characters, which would be 16 in this game but can vary in some implementations.  While this game is fun and addictive, I am apparently not very good at it and I wanted to cheat a little bit by making a program that would give me the best possible words (the longer the word the more points you get).</p>

<p>How do you create a shallow copy with git-svn from a Subversion repository, e.g. how do you pull only the last three revisions?</p>

<p>The <code>git clone</code> command can get the last n revisions from a Git repository if you use the option <code>--depth</code>, i.e. you get a shallow copy of the repository. Example:</p>

<p>Is there a similar option for git-svn?</p>

<p>So far I've only found the <code>-rN</code> option where <code>N</code> is the revision to pull. Example:</p>

<pre><code>git svn clone -rN svn://some/repo
</code></pre>

<p>According to the documentation there is the possibility to use <code>-r$REVNUMBER:HEAD</code>. I tried the following to get the last 3 revisions which returned an error message.</p>

<pre><code>$ git svn clone --prefix=svn/ -s -rHEAD~3:HEAD http://some/svn/repo .
revision argument: HEAD~3:HEAD not understood by git-svn
</code></pre>

<p>So I replaced <code>HEAD~3</code> with the actual number of the third but last revision 534. That worked, but that requires me to first figure out the revision number of the third but last commit.</p>

<p>According to a comment toward <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/752479/am-i-initializing-my-c-reference-variables-correctly"">this question I just asked, regarding initializing references</a>, returning a reference can be evil because, [as I understand] it makes it easier to miss deleting it, which can lead to memory leaks.</p>

<p>This worries me, as I have followed examples (unless I'm imagining things) and done this in a fair few places... Have I misunderstood? Is it evil? If so, just how evil?</p>

I have explained every aspect of them I could think of, but it seems they are waiting for me to mention something specific, and I don't know what it is.</p>

<p>From my experience I think the following is true. If I am missing a major point please let me know.</p>

<p><strong>Interface:</strong></p>

<p>Every single Method declared in an Interface will have to be implemented in the subclass.
Only Events, Delegates, Properties (C#) and Methods can exist in a Interface. A class can implement multiple Interfaces.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract Class:</strong></p>

<p>Only Abstract methods have to be implemented by the subclass. An Abstract class can have normal methods with implementations. Abstract class can also have class variables beside Events, Delegates, Properties and Methods. A class can only implement one abstract class only due non-existence of Multi-inheritance in C#.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>After all that, the interviewer came up with the question ""What if you had an Abstract class with only abstract methods? How would that be different from an interface?"" I didn't know the answer but I think it's the inheritance as mentioned above right?</p></li>
<li><p>An another interviewer asked me what if you had a Public variable inside the interface, how would that be different than in Abstract Class? I insisted you can't have a public variable inside an interface. I didn't know what he wanted to hear but he wasn't satisfied either.</p></li>

<p>I am not sure how to implement pagination on a resource in a RESTful web application.
Assuming that I have a resource called <code>products</code>, which of the following do you think is the best approach, and why:</p>

<h2>1. Using only query strings</h2>

<p>eg. <code>http://application/products?page=2&amp;sort_by=date&amp;sort_how=asc</code>
<br />The problem here is that I can't use full page caching and also the URL is not very clean and easy to remember.</p>

<h2>2. Using pages as resources and query strings for sorting</h2>

<p>eg. <code>http://application/products/page/2?sort_by=date&amp;sort_how=asc</code>
<br />In this case, the problem that is see is that <code>http://application/products/pages/1</code> is not a unique resource since using <code>sort_by=price</code> can yield a totally different result <em>and</em> I still can't use page caching.</p>

<h2>3. Using pages as resources and an URL segment for sorting</h2>

<p>eg. <code>http://application/products/by-date/page/2</code>
<br />I personally see no problem in using this method, but someone warned me that this is not a good way to go (he didn't give a reason, so if you know <em>why</em> it's not recommended, please let me know)</p>

This dynamically loaded <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> had a pre-selected value.  In IE6, we already had code to fix the selected <code>&lt;option&gt;</code>, because sometimes the <code>&lt;select&gt;</code>'s <code>selectedIndex</code> value would be out of sync with the selected <code>&lt;option&gt;</code>'s <code>index</code> attribute, as below:</p>

<pre><code>field.selectedIndex = element.index;
</code></pre>

<p>However, this code wasn't working.  Even though the field's <code>selectedIndex</code> was being set correctly, the wrong index would end up being selected.  However, if I stuck an <code>alert()</code> statement in at the right time, the correct option would be selected.  Thinking this might be some sort of timing issue, I tried something random that I'd seen in code before:</p>

<pre><code>var wrapFn = (function() {
    var myField = field;
    var myElement = element;

    return function() {
        myField.selectedIndex = myElement.index;

})();
setTimeout(wrapFn, 0);

<p>As of C# 6, <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/45949862/3195477"">the answer</a> to this question is:</p>

<pre><code>SomeEvent?.Invoke(this, e);
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>I frequently hear/read the following advice:</p>

<p>Always make a copy of an event before you check it for <code>null</code> and fire it. This will eliminate a potential problem with threading where the event becomes <code>null</code> at the location right between where you check for null and where you fire the event:</p>

<pre><code>// Copy the event delegate before checking/calling
EventHandler copy = TheEvent;

if (copy != null)
    copy(this, EventArgs.Empty); // Call any handlers on the copied list
</code></pre>

<p><em>Updated</em>: I thought from reading about optimizations that this might also require the event member to be volatile, but Jon Skeet states in his answer that the CLR doesn't optimize away the copy.</p>

<p>But meanwhile, in order for this issue to even occur, another thread must have done something like this:</p>

<pre><code>// Better delist from event - don't want our handler called from now on:
otherObject.TheEvent -= OnTheEvent;
// Good, now we can be certain that OnTheEvent will not run...
</code></pre>

<p>The actual sequence might be this mixture:</p>

<pre><code>// Copy the event delegate before checking/calling
EventHandler copy = TheEvent;

// Better delist from event - don't want our handler called from now on:
otherObject.TheEvent -= OnTheEvent;    
// Good, now we can be certain that OnTheEvent will not run...

if (copy != null)
    copy(this, EventArgs.Empty); // Call any handlers on the copied list
</code></pre>

<p>The point being that <code>OnTheEvent</code> runs after the author has unsubscribed, and yet they just unsubscribed specifically to avoid that happening. Surely what is really needed is a custom event implementation with appropriate synchronisation in the <code>add</code> and <code>remove</code> accessors. And in addition there is the problem of possible deadlocks if a lock is held while an event is fired.</p>

<p>So is this <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult_programming"" rel=""noreferrer"">Cargo Cult Programming</a>? It seems that way - a lot of people must be taking this step to protect their code from multiple threads, when in reality it seems to me that events require much more care than this before they can be used as part of a multi-threaded design. Consequently, people who are not taking that additional care might as well ignore this advice - it simply isn't an issue for single-threaded programs, and in fact, given the absence of <code>volatile</code> in most online example code, the advice may be having no effect at all.</p>

<p>(And isn't it a lot simpler to just assign the empty <code>delegate { }</code> on the member declaration so that you never need to check for <code>null</code> in the first place?)</p>

<p><em>Updated:</em> In case it wasn't clear, I did grasp the intention of the advice - to avoid a null reference exception under all circumstances. My point is that this particular null reference exception can only occur if another thread is delisting from the event, and the only reason for doing that is to ensure that no further calls will be received via that event, which clearly is NOT achieved by this technique. You'd be concealing a race condition - it would be better to reveal it! That null exception helps to detect an abuse of your component. If you want your component to be protected from abuse, you could follow the example of WPF - store the thread ID in your constructor and then throw an exception if another thread tries to interact directly with your component. Or else implement a truly thread-safe component (not an easy task).</p>

<p>So I contend that merely doing this copy/check idiom is cargo cult programming, adding mess and noise to your code. To actually protect against other threads requires a lot more work.</p>

<p><strong>Update in response to Eric Lippert's blog posts:</strong></p>

<p>So there's a major thing I'd missed about event handlers: ""event handlers are required to be robust in the face of being called even after the event has been unsubscribed"", and obviously therefore we only need to care about the possibility of the event delegate being <code>null</code>. <em>Is that requirement on event handlers documented anywhere?</em></p>

<p>And so: ""There are other ways to solve this problem; for example, initializing the handler to have an empty action that is never removed. But doing a null check is the standard pattern.""</p>

<p>So the one remaining fragment of my question is, <em>why is explicit-null-check the ""standard pattern""?</em> The alternative, assigning the empty delegate, requires only <code>= delegate {}</code> to be added to the event declaration, and this eliminates those little piles of stinky ceremony from every place where the event is raised. It would be easy to make sure that the empty delegate is cheap to instantiate. Or am I still missing something?</p>

<p>Surely it must be that (as Jon Skeet suggested) this is just .NET 1.x advice that hasn't died out, as it should have done in 2005?</p>

<p><strong>My goal is to inspire students that programming is cool</strong>. </p>

<p>We <em>know</em> that programming is cool because you can create anything you imagine - it's the ultimate creative outlet.  I want to inspire these beginners and get them over as many early-learning humps as I can.</p>

<p>Now, my reasons are selfish.  I'm teaching an <em>Intro to Computing</em> course to a group of 60 half-engineering, half business majors; all freshmen.  They are the students who came from underprivileged High schools.  From my past experience, the group is generally split as follows: a few <a href=""http://www.google.com/#hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=Rockstar+Programmers&amp;fp=WnpED7D_IvM"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">rock-stars</a>, some who try very hard and <em>kind of</em> get it, the few who try very hard and <em>barely</em> get it, and the few who don't care.  I want to reach as many of these groups as effectively as I can. Here's an example of how I'd use a computer program to teach:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Here's an example of what I'm looking
  for:  a 1-line VBS script to get your
  computer to talk to you:</p>

<pre><code>CreateObject(""sapi.spvoice"").Speak InputBox(""Enter your text"",""Talk it"")
</code></pre>
  
  <p>I could use this to demonstrate order
  of operations.  I'd show the code, let
  them play with it, then explain that
  There's a lot going on in that line,
  but the computer can make sense of it,
  because it knows the rules.  Then I'd
  show them something like this:</p>

<pre><code>4(5*5) / 10 + 9(.25 + .75)
</code></pre>
  
  <p>And you can see that first I need to
  do is (5*5).  Then I can multiply for
  4.  And now I've created the Object.  Dividing by 10 is the same as calling
  Speak - I can't Speak before I have an
  object, and I can't divide before I
  have 100.  Then on the other side I
  first create an InputBox with some
  instructions for how to display it. 
  When I hit enter on the input box it
  evaluates or ""returns"" whatever I
  entered.  (Hint: 'oooooo' makes a
  funny sound)  So when I say Speak, the
  right side is what to Speak.  And I
  get that from the InputBox.</p>
  
  <p>So when you do several things on a
  line, like:</p>

<pre><code>x = 14 + y;
</code></pre>
  
  <p>You need to be aware of the order of
  things.  First we add 14 and y.  Then
  we put the result (what it evaluates
  to, or returns) into x.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That's my goal, to have a bunch of these cool examples to demonstrate and teach the class while they have fun.  I tried this example on my roommate and while I may not use this as the first lesson, she liked it and learned something.</p>

<p>Some cool <a href=""http://reference.wolfram.com/legacy/v5/Tour/WritingProgramsInMathematica.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">mathematica programs that make beautiful graphs or shapes</a> that are easy to understand would be good ideas and I'm going to look into those.

<p>In part, Fowler states, ""<em>With service locator the application class asks for it [the service] explicitly by a message to the locator. With injection there is no explicit request, the service appears in the application class - hence the inversion of control.
Inversion of control is a common feature of frameworks, but it's something that comes at a price. It tends to be hard to understand and leads to problems when you are trying to debug. So on the whole I prefer to avoid it [Inversion of Control] unless I need it. This isn't to say it's a bad thing, just that I think it needs to justify itself over the more straightforward alternative.</em>""</p>

<p>In creating a new service which needs to have the data it transmits secure.  We've entered a debate over which approach is more secure - REST with HTTPS or a SOAP WS with WS-Security.</p>

<p>I am under the impression we could use HTTPS for all the web service calls and this approach would be secure.  The way I look at it is, ""if HTTPS is good enough for bank and financial web sites, it's good enough for me"".  Again, I'm not expert in this space, but I'd think that these people have thought considerably hard about this problem and are comfortable with HTTPS.</p>

<p>A coworker disagrees and says SOAP and WS-Security is the only way to go.</p>

"859111","<p>A module I'm adding to our large Java application has to converse with another company's SSL-secured website.  The problem is that the site uses a self-signed certificate.  I have a copy of the certificate to verify that I'm not encountering a man-in-the-middle attack, and I need to incorporate this certificate into our code in such a way that the connection to the server will be successful.</p>

<p>Here's the basic code:</p>

<pre><code>void sendRequest(String dataPacket) {
  String urlStr = ""https://host.example.com/"";
  URL url = new URL(urlStr);
  HttpURLConnection conn = (HttpURLConnection)url.openConnection();
  conn.setMethod(""POST"");
  conn.setRequestProperty(""Content-Length"", data.length());
  conn.setDoOutput(true);
  OutputStreamWriter o = new OutputStreamWriter(conn.getOutputStream());
  o.write(data);
  o.flush();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Without any additional handling in place for the self-signed certificate, this dies at conn.getOutputStream() with the following exception:</p>

<pre><code>Exception in thread ""main"" javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: sun.security.validator.ValidatorException: PKIX path building failed: sun.security.provider.certpath.SunCertPathBuilderException: unable to find valid certification path to requested target
....
Caused by: sun.security.validator.ValidatorException: PKIX path building failed: sun.security.provider.certpath.SunCertPathBuilderException: unable to find valid certification path to requested target
....
Caused by: sun.security.provider.certpath.SunCertPathBuilderException: unable to find valid certification path to requested target
</code></pre>

<p>Ideally, my code needs to teach Java to accept this one self-signed certificate, for this one spot in the application, and nowhere else.</p>

<p>I know that I can import the certificate into the JRE's certificate authority store, and that will allow Java to accept it.  That's not an approach I want to take if I can help; it seems very invasive to do on all of our customer's machines for one module they may not use; it would affect all other Java applications using the same JRE, and I don't like that even though the odds of any other Java application ever accessing this site are nil.  It's also not a trivial operation: on UNIX I have to obtain access rights to modify the JRE in this way.</p>

<p>I've also seen that I can create a TrustManager instance that does some custom checking.  It looks like I might even be able to create a TrustManager that delegates to the real TrustManager in all instances except this one certificate.  But it looks like that TrustManager gets installed globally, and I presume would affect all other connections from our application, and that doesn't smell quite right to me, either.</p>

<p>What is the preferred, standard, or best way to set up a Java application to accept a self-signed certificate?  Can I accomplish all of the goals I have in mind above, or am I going to have to compromise?  Is there an option involving files and directories and configuration settings, and little-to-no code?</p>
